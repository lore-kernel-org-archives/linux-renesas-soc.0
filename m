So, in my words: in that case, the device is not really active since the
clocks are not enabled?

We have tmio_mmc_clk_enable() already for that, I'd think. Or am I
misunderstanding?

Welllll... I hope we can avoid this ;)

Thanks for your thoughts, Ulf. And thanks to Geert for bringing up the
issue which I can reproduce here. We need to do a bigger PM
re-evaluation anyhow, I'll add it to the list...
