Hi,

This series extend the Renesas R-Car Gen3 thermal driver to try and read 
its calibration constants from hardware instead of using pseudo values 
hard-coded in the driver.

Unfortunately one registers involved in are not yet documented in 
datasheets and I don't have access to any board where the calibration 
data is fused. For the not documented register the BSP code was used as 
a reference. I do believe the code is ready for upstream consumption but 
pending new datasheet and/or access to hardware where calibration is 
fused to test it marked it as RFC. Once I have addressed one or both of 
these concerns I will resend without the RFC prefix.

The code is tested on H3 and M3-W where the calibration registers are 
not fused so only the fallback logic to pseudo values are truly tested.
