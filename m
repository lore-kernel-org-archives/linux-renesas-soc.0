Yes, I used INPUT_EN to drive PBDC..
My assumption was that "users" would have had to decide when a pin was 
acting as input, when describing it in dts, rather than having to deal 
with the TRM and learn what bidirectional control is and is consequences 
(particularly, that it enables the input buffer).

But since I guess this whole driver assumes more detailed knowledge on 
the hardware compared to group-based ones, I think using BI_DIR is fine here

Just to make sure I'm following you: why RxD2 (P3_2) is not marked as 
BI_DIR? I would have expected to have the flag specified here, as it 
requires PIBC enabled (and as you said, BI_DIR drives PBDC that enables 
PIBC consequentially)

Makes total sense, and will got for it.
