So, one should be aware of that runtime PM support in these case is
going to be suboptimal.
For example, when using this native card detect, you will need to keep
the controller runtime PM resumed as the be able to keep the clock on
and to be able to fetch the irq. Wasting power.

Most SoC vendors are therefore using a GPIO card detect instead,
although I assume you already knew that. :-)
