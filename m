Hi Geert,

Thanks for your hard work!

I tested this series using this setup:

- Base latest renesas-drivers, 710def1a48c7bc9d ("of_mdio: Fix broken 
  PHY IRQ in case of probe deferral"). This branch also includes the 
  RAVB WoL patches.

- Salvator-X H3 ES1.0

- The arm64 defconfig.

The test procedure I used:

    arm64 ~/shared/deep-sleep # cat sleep.sh
    #!/bin/bash

    ethtool -s eth0 wol g

    echo disabled > /sys/devices/platform/soc/e6800000.ethernet/power/wakeup

    echo 0 > /sys/module/printk/parameters/console_suspend

    i2cset -f -y 7 0x30 0x20 0x0F

    echo "Flip Switch"
    read -n 1

    echo mem > /sys/power/state

And for me the NFS root came up OK after flipping switch back. I wonder 
what is different in our test procedures. I would like to provide my 
tested-by tag but I first want to figure out why NFS (or maybe the whole 
net interface?) don't work for you after resume.

I also know you reported an IRQ storm when resuming using WoL which I in 
over 1000 suspend/resume cycles never have been able to reproduce. Maybe 
my test environment or procedure is to kind and/or something is falling 
thru the cracks :-( Do you notice any difference in test procedure or 
console printouts?
