Hi Chris,
    thanks for testing the series

That's something I would like to discuss quite soon.
One general thing I would like is having the so-called "additional 
parameters" part of the SoC driver module, as my gut feeling is that 
different PFC hw requires different configuration options.

In example, the RZ/A1 SoC requires the input/output direction of the pin 
to be specified even when the alternate function is supposed to drive it 
(in order to enable/disable input buffer). The same applies to 
bi-directional port control as you pointed out in your example 
(bi-directional enables input buffer, but that's a consequence of how hw 
works there).

I'm almost sure the same won't be required by all existing and 
forth-coming Renesas SoCs with a pin-based PFC hardware, but maybe other 
parameters I cannot think of right now will have to be specified instead.

If we want to keep the configuration flags SoC-specific, the most easy 
way to pass them down from core module to SoC module would be 
compressing the alternate function number and other configurations in a 
single u32.

In that case the dts will look like:

renesasa,rz-pins = <BANK PORT (ALTERNATE_FUNC_# | IO_MODE | DIRECTION)>;

We could even add a parameter to separate ALTERNATE_FUNCTION from the 
additional configurations, but I don't see any advantage in doing this 
at the moment.

Can people with a broader knowledge of Renesas' SoC series ack/nack my 
assumptions here?

Thanks
