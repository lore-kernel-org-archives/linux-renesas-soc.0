Just to add the following element to the discussion.

The device supports cycling between channels by itself, sequentially 
cycling between them every 2 msec.
At the same time, gain setting is not involved in this procedure, and 
last applied is used on current sense voltage channel.

Still this does not help with un-synchronized reads of gain-dependent 
values, as offset and scale are.

Also, removing auto-gain setting routine will simplify stuff, but I 
don't see how all becomes straight forward then. I mean, if we keep gain 
at a fixed value, yes everything's easier, but it will work under a much 
more limited pre-conditions set...
