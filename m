I am not protesting! :-)

Instead I think we are rather in agreement that we are concerned about
that genpd are invoking pm_runtime_force_suspend|resume().

Something like this existed there before, but because of other
internal genpd reasons. It's an option but there are issues with it.

I think it's fragile because invoking the ->stop() callback may
trigger calls to "disable" resources (like clocks, pinctrls, etc) for
the device. Doing this at ->suspend_noirq() may be too late, as that
subsystem/driver for the resource(s) may already be system suspended.
This is the classic problem of suspending (and later resuming) devices
in in-correct order.

Today we deal with this, by drivers/subsystem assigning the right
level of callback, as well as making sure the "dpm_list" is sorted
correctly (yeah, we have device links as well).

The point is, we can go for this solution, but is it good enough?

Another option, is to simply to remove (and not replace with something
else) the calls to pm_runtime_force_ suspend|resume() from genpd. This
moves the entire responsibility to the driver, to put its device into
low power state during system suspend, but with the benefit of that it
can decide to use the correct level of suspend/resume callbacks.

No matter how we do it, changing this may introduce some potential
regressions from a power consumption point of view, however although
only for those SoCs that uses the ->start|stop() callbacks. To
mitigate these power regressions, some drivers needs to be fixed, but
that seems inevitable anyway, doesn't it?

Kind regards
