It doesn't resume them, it only increases the usage count.

It's only greater than 1 - if someone else than the PM core has
increased the usage count.

We don't need to detect this no more! Let me give you some background to why.

When the pm_runtime_force_suspend|resume() helpers were invented, we
still had CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME and CONFIG_PM_SLEEP as separate Kconfig
options.

To make sure these helpers worked for all combinations and without
introducing too much complexity, we needed to always resume the device
in pm_runtime_force_resume(). More precisely, when CONFIG_PM_SLEEP was
used without CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME, we needed to resume the device as the
driver/subsystem couldn't do it via a call to pm_runtime_get_sync()
(or similar API).

As we have merged CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME into CONFIG_PM, the above
described option has disappeared. This means the driver/bus indeed
will be able to use pm_runtime_get_sync() to resume the device at a
later point when needed.

I have been cooking a patch. Very soon I will post it and will make
sure you are on cc!

Of course any help in testing/reviewing will be highly appreciated!

Kind regards
