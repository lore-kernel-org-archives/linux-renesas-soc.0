This patch causes a regression during system resume on Renesas Salvator-XS
with R-Car H3 ES2.0:

Note that before, it printed a warning instead:

    Enabling runtime PM for inactive device (ee0a0200.usb-phy) with
active children
    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1741 at drivers/base/power/runtime.c:1300
pm_runtime_enable+0x94/0xd8

Reverting commit 0408584d580d4a2c ("PM / runtime: Rework
pm_runtime_force_suspend/resume()") fixes the crash.

Note that applying Ulf's "[PATCH v2 0/3] phy: core: Re-work runtime PM
deployment and fix an issue"
(https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-renesas-soc/msg21719.html) instead
does not fix the crash.

With more debug code added, it seems the EHCI module clocks (701-703) are
enabled earlier than before. I guess this triggers the workqueue to perform
an operation while another related device (HSUSB 704?) is still disabled?

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
