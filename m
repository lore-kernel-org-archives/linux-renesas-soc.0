If I set the DMA mask to a small value, DMA is never used, and SWIOTLB
always falls back to bounce buffers (and DMAing from the small pool)?

That's the inverse of what I want to achieve: I want to avoid using the
bounce feature, to make sure the DMA engine is always used with whatever
kind of memory.
