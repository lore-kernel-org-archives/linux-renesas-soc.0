Thanks, retrying...

OK, without 'device_type = "pci"' it makes much more sense...

Having working links in the DT bindings would be great.

BTW, seems like I still have an offline copy of v2.0 of the PCI spec in
PostScript format, from my CHRP days[*], when hard disks where smaller
than CD-Rs ;-)

[*] I never managed to memorize the PCI DT bindings, though.
