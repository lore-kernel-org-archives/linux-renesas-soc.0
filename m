In v1 (https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9996567/), I had a
driver-specific "backup_mode" sysfs file.
In v2 and later of the driver series (https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/4/18/345),
I changed that to use the standard "wakeup" file in sysfs, in response to
a comment from Mark Brown.

Actually the PMIC cannot wake up the system if backup mode is not enabled.
When suspending the system (PSCI suspend) without enabling backup mode
first, the system will just crash (which cannot be distinguished from being
suspended, as PSCI doesn't support any other wake-up sources anyway[*] ;-)
So in that sense writing "enabled" to the "wakeup" file does enable the
PMIC to wake up the system.

Do you still prefer a driver-specific sysfs file?
Thanks!

[*] Perhaps you remember my ill-received attempt to prevent the system from
    using PSCI system suspend when any other wake-up sources were enabled?
    ("[PATCH/RFC 0/6] PSCI: Fix non-PMIC wake-up if SYSTEM_SUSPEND cuts
     power", https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/2/20/566).
