    It cannot be self-contained because it'll depend on the initial commit 
adding devm_pci_remap_iobase(). If you mean finding the earliest broken driver 
and introduce the deviec managed API while fixing it and then make use of that
API in the subsequent patches, that surely can be done.

    The patch interdependency would give him headache too, and I was hoping to 
relieve those with the monilitic patch. :-)

    I disagree about 4.19. The R-Car PCIe situation is as follows: given me 
missing to get the PHY driver merged into 4.18 (and the gen3 PCIe stuff 
successfully merged into 4.18), the user is bound to have PCIe not working (if 
he doesn't refer to the PHY driver in DT) or encounter a kernel BUG (if he 
does refer to the PHY driver), thus I'd like this BUG to be fixed in 4.18 time 
frame...
    Note that any PCI driver having signaled a probe deferral will also hit 
this BUG., not just R-Car one.
