The reason for the position is that while I originally had the WARN in
drm_bridge_add, I found that quite a few bridges never call drm_bridge_add.
So I moved it. Other options are to start requiring all bridge suppliers to
call drm_bridge_add or to have the WARN in both function. Too me, it would
make sense to require all bridge suppliers to call drm_bridge_add, as that
enables other init stuff later, when needed. But that is a hairy patch to
get right, and is probably best left as a separate series.

pdev is about as problematic as owner. To me it reads "platform device".
And dev for a drm_device is also somewhat problematic, and I think that
drm would have been better, but dev for drm_device is probably quite
common. But one way to go is to rename the current dev to drm, so that
dev is freed up for the owner/supplier device. But that is a tedious
patch to write (I don't do the cocci thing).

Other suggestions I can think of: odev for owner device, sdev for supplier
device or just plain supplier.

Cheers,
Peter
