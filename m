I am not sure what pain you refer to? :-) So far I haven't got much
errors being reported because of its use, have you?

Moreover, to me, this small series fixes the problems in a rather trivial way.

Yes, true.

On the other hand that is exactly the problem, only *some*. And more
importantly, genpd can't use them, because it can't cope with have
system wide PM callbacks to be skipped.

In other words, so far, the driver PM flags can't solve this issue.

Okay!

I agree that the phy core is today logical okay. But I think that's
also the case, if we pick up this small series.

There are many reasons and cases where a children is runtime PM
disabled, while the parent is runtime PM enabled. Moreover the runtime
PM core copes fine with that.

So I am worried that changing genpd in this regards, may introduce
other regressions. @subject series seems far less risky - and again,
to me, the changes are trivial.

Anyway, I will keep your suggestion in mind and think about, how/if
genpd can be changed.

Kind regards
