As I know which properties contain a phandle that needs to be fixed up, my 
plan is to update those properties manually with the value of the newly 
allocated phandle.

What I need here is the ability to insert the following structure in the 
device tree:

        lvds@feb90000 {
               compatible = "renesas,r8a7796-lvds"; (*)
               reg = <0 0xfeb90000 0 0x14>; (*)
               clocks = <&cpg CPG_MOD 727>; (*)

               ports {
                        #address-cells = <1>;
                        #size-cells = <0>;

                        port@0 {
                                reg = <0>;
                                lvds0_in: endpoint {
                                        remote-endpoint = <&du_out_lvds0>; (*)
                                };
                        };
                        port@1 {
                                reg = <1>;
                                lvds0_out: endpoint {
                                        remote-endpoint = <&panel_in>; (*)
                                };
                        };
                };
        };

with the node unit address and all properties marked with a (*) computed at 
runtime based on information extract from the device tree. Additionally I need 
phandles for the lvds0_in and lvds0_out nodes, and set the value of two 
properties in the tree with those phandles.

I've used overlays as that was the only way I found to allocate phandles, but 
any other API will work for me as well.
