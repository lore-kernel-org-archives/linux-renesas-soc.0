Subject: [PATCH 06/13] ARM: dts: r8a7779: Remove unnecessary clock-output-names properties
Date: Tue, 22 Mar 2016 10:40:33 +0900
Message-Id: <1458610840-15194-7-git-send-email-horms+renesas@verge.net.au>
In-Reply-To: <1458610840-15194-1-git-send-email-horms+renesas@verge.net.au>
References: <1458610840-15194-1-git-send-email-horms+renesas@verge.net.au>
List-ID: <linux-renesas-soc.vger.kernel.org>

* Fixed rate and fixed factor clocks do not require an
  clock-output-names property.
* Since 07705583e920fef6 ("clk: shmobile: div6: Make clock-output-names
  optional") Renesas div6 clocks do not require a clock-output-names
  property.

In the above cases there is only one clock output and its name is taken
from that of the clock node.  Accordingly, remove the unnecessary
clock-output-names properties and as necessary update the node names.
