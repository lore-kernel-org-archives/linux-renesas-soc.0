I've had a look at the code in more details, and I'm not sure how we've 
reached the current situation (as I haven't followed the multiple versions of 
this patch series due to lack of time), but it's a very big mess.

arch_setup_dma_ops() is currently not the only way to create a mapping and 
attach it to a device. Not only that, but with the current ARM32 dma-mapping 
implementation, it can't be.

arch_setup_dma_ops() will create a separate mapping for every device. That's 
certainly fine when every device has its own IOMMU instance (or at least its 
own TLB in a shared IOMMU), but that's far from being true in all cases. 
Renesas R-Car Gen2 hardware, for instance, share IOMMUs and TLBs between 
multiple devices. That's why the ipmmu-vmsa driver creates the mapping 
manually with arm_iommu_create_mapping() and attaches it to the device with 
arm_iommu_attach_device(). We need to keep supporting this mechanism until the 
ARM32 dma-mapping API is brought in line with the ARM64 implementation that 
lets the IOMMU core manage the IOVA address space.

We're unfortunately far from that, so, for the time being, we need to keep 
supporting arm_iommu_attach_device(). How that can work with deferred probing, 
I will let you figure it out, but we need to at least fix the breakage for 
v4.12.
