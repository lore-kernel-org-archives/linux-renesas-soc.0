Thanks!

Not encoding multiple things into reg means adding more properties to provide
that information, iff we want to describe the PM Domain Nodes in DT.
I considered the reg property a two-dimensional address space.

Taking the lessons from CCF and the new CPG/MSSR bindings into account
(which was BTW designed after the SYSC DT bindings), perhaps the PM Domain
hierarchy should be moved from DT to C, in the driver, too?

That would mean we have in DT:
  1) "#power-domain-cells = <1>"
  2) defines for the various domains, e.g. "#define R8A7791_PD_CA15_SCU      12"
  3) e.g. "power-domains = <&sysc R8A7791_PD_CA15_SCU>"
  4) and we can get rid of the fallback compatibility strings again.

Thoughts?
