Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: porter: remove enable prop from HS-USB device node
Date: Wed,  2 Mar 2016 10:05:44 +0900

From: Sergei Shtylyov <sergei.shtylyov@cogentembedded.com>

In  the final versions of the Porter board (called "PORTER_C") Renesas
decided to get rid  of the Maxim Integrated MAX3355 OTG chip and didn't
add any other provision to differ the host/gadget mode, so we'll have to
remove  no longer valid "renesas,enable-gpio" property from the HS-USB
device node.  Hopefully, the earlier revisions of the board were never
seen in the wild...
