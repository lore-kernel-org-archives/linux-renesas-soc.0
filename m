Subject: [PATCH v2 0/6] tmio: add support for eMMC with 8 bit bus width
Date: Mon, 19 Sep 2016 14:49:15 +0200

This series enables SDHI instances on R-Car Gen3 to access eMMC with 8 bit bus
width. I think the patch descriptions speak for themselves.

I decided to not protect this new feature with a flag because it needs
specifically to be enabled by setting the bus width to 8. No legacy platform
does that.

Note that I decided to use the pattern that pinctrl-0 is 3.3v and
pinctrl-1 is 1.8v, although the eMMC is fixed at 1.8v. I tried a few ways to
only use pinctrl-0 being 1.8v here, but they all ended up to be confusing for
users IMO, so I sticked to the most consistent solution after all.

Changes since V1:

* merged the two distinct series (drivers + DTS) into one: patches 1-4 are for
  Ulf, I will ping Simon for patches 5+6 when the time is ready.

* DTS now contains 'non-removable' and we have a software workaround for now.

These patches are based on top of Simon's sdr104-v7 patches but they apply to
current mmc/next as well. A branch can be found here:
