Hi Stephen,

Thanks for your answers!

Yes they would: this is moving functionality from platform code to DT.
Without the DT updates, it will break bisection (except for R-Car Gen2,
where we have fallback code to handle old DTBs).

Everything could go through arm-soc only with your Acked-by.
However, there are new clock drivers pending on this series.
Either they have to go through arm-soc, too, or this series would
be pulled into the clk tree with these new clock drivers.

Part E can indeed by postponed.
But if parts A-D are applied together, there's no reason to postpone part E.

That would require adding more backwards compatibility code for
old DTBs, even for platform where we're not interested in maintaining
that. In addition, Part C depends on the header file for the reset driver
to compile the clock driver, even if you would add some DT detection,
and on the reset driver to link. So I'm afraid this is not feasible.

Thanks again!
