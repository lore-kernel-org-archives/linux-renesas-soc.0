Set PHY rxc-skew-ps to 1500 and all other values to their default values.

This is intended to to address failures in the case of 1Gbps communication
using the by salvator-x board with the KSZ9031RNX phy. This has been
reported to occur with both the r8a7795 (H3) and r8a7796 (M3-W) SoCs.

v1 [Simon Horman]
* Do not set values to defaults, omit them and let the driver set the defaults
* Rewrote changelog

  N.B. The communications failures have been reported by the BSP team,
       however I did not observe them during testing with a
       salvator-x/M3-W-ES1.0

       My test-case was to bring up the system using NFS root and
       run: netperf -H <HOST>
