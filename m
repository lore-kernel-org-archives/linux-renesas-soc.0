  arm64: dts: renesas: r8a77970: use SYSC power domain macros (2017-12-05 09:30:48 +0100)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Renesas ARM64 Based SoC DT Updates for v4.16

* Use r8a77970 (V3M) CPG core clock and SYSC power domain macros

  These may be used in place of numeric constants now that they
  are present in Linus's tree.

* Add r8a77970 (V3M) Starter Kit board support

  This includes basic support to bring up the board with a serial
  console and EtherAVB support

* Add IPMMU nodes and connections to on-chip devices
  on r8a7795 (H3), r8a7796 (M3-W), r8a77970 (V3M) and r8a77995 (D3) SoCs

  Simon Horman says "With these patches applied a white list enabled IPMMU
  driver may be used to check silicon revision and then enable IPMMU in the
  known working cases."

* Enable DMA for SCIF2 on r8a77995 (D2) SoC

* Increase the number of GPIO bank 1 ports to 29 on r8a7795 (H3) SoC

  This adds support for the GP-1-28 port pin of the r8a7795 (H3) ES2.0 SoC

* Add support for CAN to r8a77995 (D3) SoC

  Ulrich Hecht says "This is a by-the-datasheet implementation, with the
  datasheet missing some bits, namely the pin map.  I filled in the gaps...
  by deducing the information from pin numbers already in the PFC driver,
  so careful scrutiny is advised."

* Add support for SDHI to r8a77995 (D3) SoC

* Add SoC name to file header of r8a7795 (H3) and r8a7796 (M3-W)
  Salvator-X and Salvator-XS board files

  Geert Uytterhoeven says "With the proliferation of Salvator-X and
  Salvator-XS boards carrying different R-Car Gen3 SoCs variants, several
  DTS files ended up having the same file headers.

  Add the SoC names to the file headers to avoid confusion."

* Add device note for ROHM BD9571MWV PMIC to
  r8a7795 (H3) and r8a7796 (M3-W) Salvator-X and Salvator-XS boards.

  Geert Uytterhoeven says "This was based on the example in the DT binding
  documentation, but using IRQ0 instead of a GPIO interrupt, as that
  matches the schematics, and because INTC-EX is a simpler block."

* Enable USB2.0 channel 0 on r8a77970 (V3M) ULCB Kingfisher board

  Vladimir Barinov says "The dedicated USB0_PWEN pin is used to control
  CN13 VBUS source from U43 power supply.  MAX3355 can also provide VBUS,
  hence it should be disabled via OTG_OFFVBUSn node coming from gpio
  expander TCA9539.  Set MAX3355 enabled using OTG_EXTLPn node to be able
  to read OTG ID of CN13."

* Add support for r8a7795 (M3-W) Salvator-XS board

  Geert Uytterhoeven says "This patch series adds support for the version
  of the Salvator-XS development board equipped with an R-Car M3-W SiP.

  The DT was based on work for the Salvator-X and -XS boards with M3-W
  resp. H3 SiPs."

* Add watchdog timer support to r8a77970 (V3M) eagle board

  Geert Uytterhoven says "This allows to use the watchdog timer to reset
  the board, until PSCI is enhanced to include such functionality."

* Use Use R-Car SDHI Gen3 fallback on r8a7795 (H3) and r8a7796 (M3-W) SoCs

* Set driver type for MMC on r8a7795 (H3) and r8a7796 (M3-W) Salvator-X and
  Salvator-XS boards.

  Wolfram Sang says "These boards are known to have eMMC issues with the
  default driver type.  Specify a working one."
