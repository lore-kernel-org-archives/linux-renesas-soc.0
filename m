Yes, that's the plan. I didn't want to make that change now, as someone
may object against the always-on power domain. On r8a7795 it feels more
natural, as it also has I/O devices in SYSC power areas, unlike R-Car Gen2
and H1.

Note that it also complicates the rcar-sysc core driver: it has to choose
between the cpg_mssr_*() or cpg_mstp_*() callbacks, depending on SoC, and also
depending on DTS if we migrate the older SoCs to CPG/MSSR and want to
maintain backwards-compatibility.

Time to finish the "renesas,apmu" enable-method work, and celebrate one big
flag day for all the new DT evolutions?

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
