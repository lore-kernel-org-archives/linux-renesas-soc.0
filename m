If your current patch bombing is successful then it will, at least in the
short term. But my comments relate to the current best practice,
not the one you seem to be trying to introduce.

Yes, err indicates its an error path.

I prefer to stress the unwind path as that is the most important
aspect of the error path.


I have no interest in a prelonged debate about the naming of labels.
As I pointed out its a spurious aspect of your change. If you wish me to
Ack your change then please either drop that change or update it - as I
already suggested. Else lets discontinue this sub-thread.
