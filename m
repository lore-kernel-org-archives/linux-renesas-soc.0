I don't agree. In my opinion hot-plug is an essential feature of a
modern device driver framework and if ASoC wants to claim to fall in
this category we ought to support it. Hotplug is something that always
pops up sooner or later. E.g. if someone puts a ASoC supported CODEC on
a hot-pluggable device (maybe USB) we don't want to duplicate the code,
but be able to reuse.

One area that e.g. requires hot-plug/-unplug and were ASoC supported
devices are used is embedded development boards that support shields and
devicetree overlays. Like e.g. RPI and similar.

The reason why we don't support hot-unplug in ASoC at the moment is
because it is not trivial to implement and nobody has cared enough yet.

But if somebody wants to and has the resources to implement this we
should not discourage this.

I'd very much prefer to have proper hot-plug support instead of
prohibiting unbinding even on systems that do not require hot-plug
support normally. It's a much cleaner solution.
