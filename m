Please see Figure 6.2 ("Procedure for Changing Pin Function from Peripheral
function to GPIO."), which says clearing a bit in GPSR is sufficient to
configure the corresponding pin as a GPIO.

The other way around is around (GPIO->IP) is not possible because of this check in sh_pfc_func_set_mux.

Thanks for verifying!

Thanks, that sounds great!
