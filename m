According to the datasheet, it's the "GMII reference clock signal", which is an
input, and can be used as one of the options for the gPTP clock.
So that makes it optional.

We have only two in-tree users of RAVB:
iwg20d-q7-common.dtsi
r8a7745-iwg22d-sodimm.dts

On both, GTXREFCLK is wired to the CLK125_NDO/LED_MODE _input_ of the
KSZ9031MNXIA PHY, so there it is used as an output?

But currently there's no way to enable it on r8a7790?
If it is optional, it should have its own pingroup.

And this is inconsistent with the other R-Car Gen2 platforms.

We cannot move it out because of backwards compatibility (this is DT ABI).
But we can create a new group named "rgmii" without it, and add a separate
"txcrefclk" group.

This we can fix easily, as it is not yet upstream.

OK (so this one looks best ;-)

Cannot be changed because of backwards compatibility.

OK.

While we can add a separate "tx_er" group, we cannot change the "mii" groups
on the other R-Car Gen2 SoCs.
So just making r8a7790 consistent with the others looks like the path of
least harm to me...

I mean it doesn't include MDIO/MDC, which are part of "rgmii" according to
Wikipedia.
