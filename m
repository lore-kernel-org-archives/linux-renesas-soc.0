I don't think that's good enough. They're all listed as optional in video-
interfaces.txt as the generic documentation can't know whether a particular=
=20
device will require a particular property or not. It's the responsibility o=
f=20
device DT bindings to refine the bindings description. The VIN DT bindings=
=20
should explicitly list the properties that apply to the VIN and tell whethe=
r=20
they're optional or mandatory for the VIN. For optional properties, the=20
default behaviour when the property is not specified should be documented t=
oo.

=46or instance, does VIN support selecting which pixel clock edge to sample=
 data=20
on ? If so the pclk-sample property should listed as either mandatory or=20
optional with a documented default, even if not used by the driver today.

No driver should parse properties of remote nodes, as those properties are =
to=20
be interpreted in the context of the remote node's DT bindings, which the=20
driver doesn't know about. Parsing OF graph properties (ports and endpoints=
)=20
is an exception, as by connecting a remote node to the local node with OF=20
graph properties you imply that the remote node uses OF graph DT bindings, =
so=20
those properties (and only those properties) can be parsed.

Properties are specified on both endpoints to account for components such a=
s=20
inverter gates between the two devices. They can thus be different on the t=
wo=20
sides, that's perfectly valid. The VIN driver should parse its local=20
properties, not the remote properties.
