Functionally, I tested these patches on an RZ/A1H RSK board (after modifyin=
g the DT for the RSK vs the GENMAI board).

The following worked fine:
 * SCIF
 * I2C
 * SDHI
 * Ethernet

  (The trick is you have to know what pins need to be set as bi-directional=
)


I will look over the code and provide feedback separately.

Cheers

Chris
