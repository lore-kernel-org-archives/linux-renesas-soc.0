Hi Olof, Hi Kevin, Hi Arnd,

Please consider these Renesas ARM based SoC DT updates for v4.12.

* Conflicts

  "Add watchdog timer to r7s72100 SoC", which is part of this patch-set,
  has a minor conflict with "ARM: 8661/1: dts: r7s72100: add l2 cache",
  which I believe Russell King has in his tree.

  The resolution is to take both.

  ARM: dts: silk: Drop superfluous status update for frequency override (2017-03-13 10:19:35 +0100)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Renesas ARM Based SoC DT Updates for v4.12

Cleanup:
* Drop superfluous status update for frequency override on various boards
* Always use status "okay" to enable devices on porger board
* Add INTC-SYS clock to device tree of various SoCs
* Tidyup Audio-DMAC channel for DVC on r8a779[013] SoCs
* Remove unit-address and reg from integrated cache on various SoCs
* Switch from ARCH_SHMOBILE_MULTI to ARCH_RENESAS
* Fix SCIFB0 dmas indentation on r8a774[35] SoCs

Enhancements:
* Add watchdog timer to r7s72100 SoC
* Update sdhi clock bindings on r7s72100 SoC
