OK, I thought I had told this before. What do you mean by PSCI system
suspend can't wakeup from the configured wakeup source. You just said
above that you can wake up from the switch.

Just enabling the wakeup sources in Linux doesn't mean you can enter
system suspend anytime. You must enter only the state from which you can
resume. And in your case if you can't wakeup from WLAN or wakeup source
you have configured then simply don't enter system suspend.

That's because your CPU_SUSPEND implementation is incomplete. You can
enter the same state as secondary CPU core off even with idle. It's just
that we can save by not entering and exiting the CPU hotplug state
machine. So this "shallow" state can be achieved if your CPU_SUSPEND
implements that state.

Yes I understood that, you need to add an extra idle states to get that
shallow state. We have discussed this in past to depth. On ARM64/PSCI,
we will that support "shallow" system suspend mode which can't be
defined generically. Also we can support this shallow state with s2idle.

Your system probably not supporting all the CPU idle states. E.g.: it
may just support CPU ON/OFF/RET and not cluster ON/OFF/RET. Please add
that state to CPU_SUSPEND implementation in the firmware.

In that case don't enter PSCI SYSTEM_SUSPEND

Why can't you do that in s2idle mode. Please give me the difference
between your shallow state and s2idle state, not just power numbers
but the actual state of CPUs and the devices in the system.

Linux can just leave the wakeup interrupts enabled in the interrupt
controller and the PSCI implementation can understand that. That's what
we mean when we say platform must deal with that. It should not enter
the state blindly if it can't wake up with those sources. It's not
always necessary to communicate such details via dedicated PSCI APIs.
It's impossible and not scalable in a system with 100s of interrupt
sources. Platform can deal with that in better and simple ways than APIs
to exchange such information.

And again that's exactly what s2idle implementation. So NACK for each
patch in this series.

Still possible with s2idle if CPU_SUSPEND is correctly implemented by
the platform.

How is that ? If "deep" is available as in your case too, why will
shallow become default. IIUC the user still have to write "shallow"
to mem_sleep.

Again to re-iterate, we will not support the not so well defined
"shallow" sleep state unless it's proved that the same can't be done
with cpuidle.

Yes exactly and that's one reason why "shallow" is useless as it's not
well defined or should I say ill-defined.

Yes, go and fix the CPU_SUSPEND to implement all the idle states correctly.

Does this platform use generic arm64 DT cpuidle driver ? I don't see so
from the DT.
