My point (not expressed clearly) was that, as I'll need a different vsps 
property, I can as well go for a different compatible string.

As the ports are identical it makes sense to share the same board DTS, I agree 
with you. We could override the compatible string in r8a7795-es1.dtsi and 
leave it blank in r8a7795.dtsi for now, as there's no driver support for 
ES2.0. That's a bit of a workaround as it shouldn't matter to DT whether 
driver support is available or not. On the other hand, leaving the vsps 
property out is a workaround too.

The current driver will fail probing if the number of VSPs is different than 
the number of CRTCs, so I believe you can keep the vsps property in 
r8a7795.dtsi with 3 VSPS without causing any problem. However, there's no DT 
bindings for the H3 ES2.0 DU yet, so we would end up merging DT without 
bindings, which is not good. I think that regardless of how we proceed, 
keeping the DU node in the ES2.0 .dtsi will be a violation of that policy.
