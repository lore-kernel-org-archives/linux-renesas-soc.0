Thanks for testing!

I've just pushed the reverts, but the PM QoS still needs to be fixed,
so we have to get to the bottom of this.

The current theory goes that the changes in domain_governor.c are to
blame.  Is genpd involved in all of the issues with the PM QoS fix you
have seen?

Thanks,
Rafael
