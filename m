Unfortunately there seems to be a small problem with this pull request.

"ARM: dts: r7s72100: add USB device to device tree" is already
present upstream via Greg KH.

I will drop that patch, and the r7s72100 cleanup patches that depend on it
and post a v2. I'll also see about re-applying the cleanup patches for v4.18.
