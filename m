That not that uncommon for "syscon" drivers...

OK.

OK.

Good, I will resume review of the patch in $subject ;-)

You do want to:
  1. Document the two register ranges in the DT bindings,
  2. Update the driver to map both ranges on RZ/A2.
Right now it works by luck, as ioremap()'s granularity is PAGE_SIZE.
