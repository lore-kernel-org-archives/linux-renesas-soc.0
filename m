We've stumbled upon this issue some months ago and the patch below was
exactly the one that I came up with too. We've provided the feedback to
Renesas and they fixed it as [1]. As I'm laking proper data sheets for
the controller I was not able to judge it in depth, though.

Unfortunately I was not able to reproduce the original issue to test the
Renesas version [1] with enough confidence. What I can tell with
confidence is that the patch below does fix the issue that the driver
gets stuck on CMD12 and it did not have any further negative side
effects. So from my side (tested on RCar-M3):

Tested-by: Jan Kl�tzke <jan.kloetzke@preh.de>

Maybe someone from Reseas can comment on the rationale of their version
of the patch.
