Okay!

The reason why I suggested inventing a new driver PM flag, was because
I consider the ->dev.power.wakeup_path, being a status flag/bit, owned
by the PM core. In other words, consumers of the flag are allowed to
look at it, but not change it.

Anyway, I am perfectly fine to drop the DPM_FLAG_WAKEUP_PATH thingy.
However, perhaps we should still add a helper function
(device_set_wakeup_path() or similar), which users can call to set the
flag?

It works, although I would rather change the assignment of the flag to
respect if the current value is true, something like this:

dev->power.wakeup_path = dev->power.wakeup_path || p->wakeup_path;

Kind regards
