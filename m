I did see that.
But, in my opinion, using 4-bit SDHI is way more common that 1-bit SDHI.
So I figured I'd make 4-bit the 'default' by putting it in the dtsi, and if=
 for some reason someone needed 1-bit, they could override it in the board =
.dts.

It doesn't really matter to me. If you want me to move it to the board dts =
it to keep it consistent, just let me know and I'll change it.
