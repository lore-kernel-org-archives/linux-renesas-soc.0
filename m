Subject: [RFC PATCH] mmc: tmio: check mmc_regulator_get_supply return value
Date: Fri, 22 Sep 2017 12:22:17 +0100

mmc_regulator_get_supply returns -EPROBE_DEFER if either vmmc or
vqmmc regulators had their probing deferred.
vqmmc regulator is needed by UHS to work properly, therefore this
patch checks the value returned by mmc_regulator_get_supply to
make sure we have a reference to both vmmc and vqmmc (if found in
the DT).

I believe this patch is in order for UHS to work properly on the RZ/G1 platforms
as the signal voltage needs to be switched from 3.3V to 1.8V, and therefore we
need to make sure we hold a reference to vqmmc. Without this patch there is a
chance that the regulator driver gets probed later on and therefore we end up
without control over the power regulator. I have seen an RZ/G1E based platform
failing the transition to UHS because of this.
However, there are side effects to it as the mmc devices will be enumerated
in a different order (due to -EPROBE_DEFER), this means this patch would likely
break existing platforms.
Please, let me know your comments.
