Thank you for the review.

The "phys" is for Generic PHY even if this patch is applied.
So, I think that I should make a patch to revise the explanation at first?

I would to write overview of renesas_usbhs driver and a question below:

< phys >
 - This is a generic phy property.
 - The renesas_usbhs driver will use it to turn on/off the PHY 
 - Almost all platforms use this generic phy instance.

< usb-phy >
 - This is a USB-PHY property.
 - The renesas_usbhs driver will use it to call an OTG related function.
   (otg_set_peripheral)
 - The renesas_usbhs driver will NOT use it to turn the power on/off.
 - Some platforms don't use this USB-PHY instance.
  - In other words, some platforms use both a generic phy and USB-PHY.
   - Is it not suitable from the device tree point of view?

Best regards,
Yoshihiro Shimoda
