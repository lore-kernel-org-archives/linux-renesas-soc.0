It looks like what happens without the Ulf's patch is as follows.

usb-phy has children with runtime PM enabled that are not in the
domain, so without the $subject patch the pm_runtime_force_suspend()
in genpd_finish_suspend() checks the usage counter of usb-phy and
since it is 1, the parent's usage counter is not incremented and
genpd_runtime_suspend() is run for usb-phy.  On resume, the
pm_runtime_force_resume() in genpd_resume_noirq() finds that the usage
counter of usb-phy is 1, so the parent's usage counter is not
decremented (correctly) and the function returns (arguably incorrectly
if the runtime PM status of the children is "active", because it is
necessary to resume the children in that case, but the children have
no PM callbacks and even if they had had them, they would have been
run later anyway).  The parent of usb-phy is skipped by the
pm_runtime_force_resume() too, because its usage counter is 1 when it
is checked by this function.

With the $subject patch pm_runtime_force_suspend() in
genpd_finish_suspend() calls pm_runtime_need_not_resume() and that
returns "false" for usb-phy if the runtime PM status or at least one
of its children is "active" (which it is for the "phy" devices).  That
is correct, but for this reason the parent's children counter is not
decremented and both usb-phy and its parent will be resumed by the
subsequent pm_runtime_force_resume().

The pm_runtime_force_resume() in genpd_resume(_noirq) now finds that
pm_runtime_need_not_resume() returns "false" for both usb-phy and its
parent and attempts to resume them both via genpd_runtime_resume()
which is too early, because stuff they depend on hasn't been resumed
yet.  That triggers the crash (so
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10152767/ will cause the crash to
happen too).

In conclusion, without the $subject patch it all works pretty much by
accident, basically because the pm_runtime_force_resume()
inadvertently decides to skip the resume of some devices which avoids
the premature execution of genpd_runtime_resume() for them.

I'm not sure why the crash is still there in this case, but quite
likely it is related (again) to something with a child outside of the
domain that causes its parent to be treated as a device that must be
resumed and that triggers a premature execution of
genpd_runtime_resume() in genpd_resume_noirq() for the parent (because
something the parents depends on quite likely is outside of the domain
and will be resumed later).

Granted, the (indirect) invocation of genpd_runtime_suspend() in
genpd_finish_suspend() is too late for drivers that are not expecting
it to be called then (but also harmless if the drivers check the
status of the devices) and the (indirect) invocation of
genpd_runtime_resume() from genpd_resume_noirq() is too early,
especially if there are dependencies on devices outside the domains
handled by genpd.

So something like https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10152873/ is needed IMO.

Thanks,
Rafael
