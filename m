Subject: [PATCH v3 0/7] ARM/arm64: dts: renesas: Add/complete L2 cache-controller nodes
Date: Mon, 15 Feb 2016 21:38:28 +0100

	Hi Simon, Magnus,

This patch series adds the missing L2 cache-controller nodes to the
DTSes for various Renesas ARM-based SoCs, or completes the existing
nodes, and links the CPU nodes to them.

For R-Mobile APE6 (r8a73a4), the L2 cache-controllers are also linked to
the respective (already existing) SYSC Power Domains. Fortunately these
Power Domains were never powered down, as they are parents of the Power
Domains containing CPU cores. This may change in the future.

For R-Car Gen2 and Gen3 (r8a779x), this serves as a preparatory step for
adding SYSC Power Domain support later.

Changes compared to v2:
  - Dropped "arm,data-latency" and "arm,tag-latency" properties, as they
    may not be valid when using virtualization,
  - Dropped already applied parts of "[PATCH v2 6/6] arm64: renesas:
    r8a7795: Add L2 cache-controller nodes",
  - Changed one-line summary prefix to match current arm-soc practices.

This series is against renesas-devel-20160215-v4.5-rc4.
It has been tested on r8a73a4/ape6evm, r8a7791/koelsch, r8a7794/alt, and
r8a7795/salvator-x.

For your convenience, I've also pushed this series to
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/geert/renesas-drivers.git#topic/l2-cache-v3

Thanks for applying!

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
