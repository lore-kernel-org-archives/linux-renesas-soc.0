Hi Russell,

I know this has been quite a while. I didn't have further time for this
topic back then. But now I am going to revive and rework it. Still,
thank you for your input.

Full ack. It should be 'master_xfer_atomic'.

Interesting question with multiple aspects:

- The above setting will cause problems but this is orthogonal to this
  patch. It works by modifying __i2c_transfer() but all the locking logic
  is one layer above in i2c_transfer(). So, there shouldn't be a
  difference.

- We won't deadlock, because I2C core will use trylock in this case.
  However, even reporting -EAGAIN won't be helpful because the
  interrupted transfer is likely to never finish without irqs. So,
  retrying won't help and we are still stuck.

- Brainstorming: we could decide that if in_atomic() and
  master_xfer_atomic() present and the I2C client is allowed to do
  ATOMIC_IO (and maybe more checks), to ignore the locking and force
  this command on the bus. Also requiring master_xfer_atomic() to reset
  the IP core properly, etc. Probably also enforcing i2c_recover_bus()
  to ensure a free bus. This is probably the best we could do, but
  still no guarantees here. Some I2C devices just lock up when
  interrupted at the wrong time.

Relying on I2C for poweroff/reboot is a somewhat fragile design to begin
with. I will re-start this series with something simple, but keep the
above scenario in mind. Then, we can see how much we can do, hopefully.

And I got the idea for a panic-fault-injector which sounds interesting.
I will try that!

Kind regards,

   Wolfram
