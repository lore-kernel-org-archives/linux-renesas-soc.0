So you want to enable bits for your CAN clock, one in each cpu's domain.

I'd say that is a nice idea that a hardware engineer might be proud to
pick up but that results in more headache than fun for the software
colleague.

There are several problems that come immediately to mind:

 - You can switch of a clk because you don't need it on, or because you
   need it off. I guess you want to have the clock on if at least one
   cpu wants it on. So you take away the freedom from the other cpu to
   force the clock off. (Yeah, the currently available clk framework
   doesn't allow that either.)
 - What if cpu 0 sets the parent of the can clk to pll2 but cpu 1 wants
   it set to pll1? How does cpu 1 notice the change?
 - On off might be relatively easy, what about clk dividers? cpu 0 sets
   2 which cpu 1 sets 6.

That convinces me that the disadvantages of having two views on the clk
core have more weight and you really want a single view and share that
by software.

Best regards
Uwe
