Luckily the mapping for R-Car is pretty simple, I can imagine it can get very
tricky!

I saw Robin Murphy's patches for PCI IOMMU map bindings, though at the
moment to get things going I'm ignoring it because it will require quite a lot
of changes to the iommu/ipmmu-vmsa driver. Other IOMMU drivers will
also have to change a fair bit to support this new binding.

In our case, there is nothing special in programming the bridge registers
for use with an IOMMU other than the range of addresses that is exposed.
The PCI host has a HW limitation that the AXI bus addresses must be
32-bit. The HW will allow you to set up the bridge registers so that PCI
bus addresses above 32-bits are mapped into the 32-bit AXI space. This
isn't used though at the moment, the PCI:AXI mapping is simply 1:1.

Simply changing the dma-ranges prop to specify all of the 32-bit range is
enough to get it to work with the IOMMU.

Without IOMMU, the dma-ranges prop was:
dma-ranges = <0x42000000 0 0x40000000 0 0x40000000 0 0x40000000>;
Note that this does not cover all of DDR, as there is 3GiB above the 32-bit
address space. Other restrictions in the way the bridge registers are
programmed mean we cannot even map all DDR in the 32-bit space.

With the IOMMU, the dma-ranges prop is simply:
dma-ranges = <0x42000000 0 0x00000000 0 0x00000000 1 0x00000000>;

I don't think that applies, though I'm struggling a bit to understand your
comment.

Hopefully I have explained it above.

Many thanks
