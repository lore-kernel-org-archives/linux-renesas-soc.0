There are ca. 100 callers in drivers.

It depends on your meaning of "up".  My interpretation is that "up" means
ready to handle packets between physical media and the Linux networking stack.

So even when "down", the actual Ethernet controller may still be able to
receive a magic packet if WoL is enabled.  The magic packet is really a
magic packet not intended to be transmitted to the networking stack, but
merely serves as a wakeup signal.
