Could you elaborate a bit about the wakeup-path? Let me start and you
can fill in.

In $subject patch, the PM core propagates the IN_BAND_WAKEUP flag of
the device to its parent device, via the ->power.wakeup_path_in_band
flag. That becomes additional new information, as we already has the
PM core to propagate the value of device_may_wakeup() (if true) to the
parent device, via the ->power.wakeup_path flag.

I assume that isn't sufficient, because the wakeup path isn't
reflected in the child/parent hierarchy?

So, I guess this is about drivers who deals with wakeup enabled
devices and which are consumers of other resources (irqchips for
example). As part of the wakup path, these resources also needs to be
kept running, right?

In your case, what other resources besides the irqchip, can be
considered as a part of the wakeup path, but also being outside the
parent/child hierarchy of the wakeup enabled device?

Note that, an important fact as of today, is that when
GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP is set for the genpd, genpd also checks the
->power.wakeup_path flag for the device. Both conditions must be true,
else genpd powers off the PM domain (and the device).

In other words, all devices being part of the wakeup path must either
have device_may_wakeup() to return true for it or the
->power.wakeup_path set, else genpd will power off the PM domain,
regardless of whether the GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP flag is set or not.

The main reason to why I chosen the IN_BAND_WAKEUP method, is because
genpd's *default* method is to power off the PM domain (and the
device) even if wakeup is enabled for the device. Hence, genpd treats
all wakeups as default being out-of-band IRQs.

Having an OUT_BAND_WAKEUP flag, would thus only make sense for those
genpds that has GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP set, I guess that is what you
are saying as well?

We don't want to suspend the device in case of IN_BAND_WAKEUP, right!?
