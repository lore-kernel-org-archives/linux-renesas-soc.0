Oops... Where did your (offlist) bug report for rspi needing a delay after
clock enable come from?

I was aware the registers are documented to be 8-bit wide, but I always
assumed 32-bit accesses do work.

Oops, I only have MSTP early disable debug code for boards I do have
physical access to (cfr. my topic/renesas-debug branch)...

That's one option. Note that the standard name for such property seems to be
"reg-io-width".

Another option is to let the driver bind against
"renesas,r7s72100-mstp-clocks", and switch to 8-bit access mode.

CLK_OF_DECLARE(cpg_mstp_clks, "renesas,r7s72100-mstp-clocks",
cpg_mstp_clocks_init8);

cpg_mstp_clocks_init8() can set a gloal flag, and call cpg_mstp_clocks_init().

The latter means no DT update is needed, and thus preserves compatibility
with old DTBs.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
