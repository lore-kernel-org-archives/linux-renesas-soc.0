Subject: [PATCH v4 0/3] mmc: sh_mobile_sdhi: fix missing r7s72100 clocks
Date: Fri, 20 Jan 2017 14:43:29 -0500
Message-Id: <20170120194332.1683-1-chris.brandt@renesas.com>

At first this started out as a simple typo fix, until I realized
that the SDHI in the RZ/A1 has 2 clocks per channel and both need
to be turned on/off.

This patch series adds the ability to specify 2 clocks instead of
just 1, and does so for the RZ/A1 r7s72100.

This patch has been tested on an RZ/A1 RSK board. Card detect works
fine as well as bind/unbind.

v4:
* No code changes, only text udpates to explain why there are 2 clocks
  and why we need to treat them as 1 clock.
