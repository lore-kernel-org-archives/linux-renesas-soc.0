Cool.

What do you mean with clean-up here? I would have just added the helper
function checking R1 error bits and setting stop.error accordingly.

I agree. That's what I meant with "checking if stop.resp[0] has one of
the R1_* bits set which are marked with 'ex' (and probably 'erx',
too)?". I think these are the candidates we care about.

Thanks,
