Below is an alternative version of the patch that caused the problem
to happen which checks the ignore_children flag of the device.  It may
avoid the issue by accident, but then I'd rather make it not happen. :-)

Please try this patch anyway, though, and let me know if the crash is still
there.

Thanks,

Subject: [PATCH v2] PM / runtime: Rework pm_runtime_force_suspend/resume()

One of the limitations of pm_runtime_force_suspend/resume() is that
if a parent driver wants to use these functions, all of its child
drivers have to do that too because of the parent usage counter
manipulations necessary to get the correct state of the parent during
system-wide transitions to the working state (system resume).
However, that limitation turns out to be artificial, so remove it.

Namely, pm_runtime_force_suspend() only needs to update the children
counter of its parent (if there's is a parent) when the device can
stay in suspend after the subsequent system resume transition, as
that counter is correct already otherwise.  Now, if the parent's
children counter is not updated, it is not necessary to increment
the parent's usage counter in that case any more, as long as the
children counters of devices are checked along with their usage
counters in order to decide whether or not the devices may be left
in suspend after the subsequent system resume transition.

Accordingly, modify pm_runtime_force_suspend() to only call
pm_runtime_set_suspended() for devices whose usage and children
counters are at the "no references" level (the runtime PM status
of the device needs to be updated to "suspended" anyway in case
this function is called once again for the same device during the
transition under way), drop the parent usage counter incrementation
from it and update pm_runtime_force_resume() to compensate for these
changes.
