If this is not welcome, please feel free to throw away.
(then, I will name my driver 'uniphier-sd.c')

I am neutral about this renaming because it
is trying to make the wrong thing correct.


It will also produce a different inconsistency.
Even if we rename renesas_sdhi_core.c to tmio_mmc_sdhi.c ,
functions in it will be kept renesas_sdhi_*
I understand they want to keep the file name and function names consistent.


Thanks.
