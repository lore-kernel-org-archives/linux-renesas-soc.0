The reality is, I will be providing DT examples and people will just follow
them like they copy/paste the code from my rskrza1-board.c file today.
Of course they still have to look up the 'alternative function' number in t=
he
Hardware manual, but that's in an easy to read table.

Because it doesn't have to be. The pin controller itself knows how to set i=
t up
itself as soon as you set the PIPC.

PIBC (Port Input Buffer Control) is only valid when you are in GPIO input p=
ort
mode (PMCn.PMCnm =3D 0 and PMn.PMnm =3D 1).


The reality is, it would be nice if the controller could magically know how=
 to
set all the pins direction, buffers and such depending on their function, b=
ut
there were some that needed an extra signals to be manually set (whether it=
 makes
sense or not). I guess that's the consequence of mixing-and-matching IP fro=
m
different product lines. Oh well, we just fix it all in software, right?  ;=
)

I'd rather this than the PFC that's in the R-Car....which I think is the re=
sult
of trying to make it smarter and just ended up making it more complicated.


Cheers
