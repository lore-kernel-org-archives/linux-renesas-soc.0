IMO this is a bit unclear.

First off, how does the driver know that the device has to be in full
power for wakeup to work?

Second, this requirement sort of implies that the device cannot go
into a low-power state during runtime suspend too, so it basically
remains stays at full power even when runtime-suspended.

Does it then mean that the middle layer is expected to simply avoid
changing the power state of the device when enabled to wake up the
system, or is there more to that?  In the former case, it may be
better to rename the flag to something along the lines of "don't
change power state if wakeup enabled".

I'd prefer this to be BIT(4).
