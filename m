I shorted this up a bit to "RZ/G1C (r8a77470) SoC: Use r8a77470-cpg-mssr
binding definitions"

This second paragraph is redundant.

Pruned this out too, description is clear enough (we've seen a bunch of these
patches by now :).

I disagree that command line is to be preferred. It's awkward to keep
it updated everywhere, and for your product you're unlikely to change
the partition scheme very often. But it's up to you, I suppose. Seems
like needless churn though.

Device-tree is there to describe the _platform_, and sure, flash partitioning
isn't part of the pure hardware, but it is non-probable and we've got the
tradition of keeping those things in the DT.

I've also replied to the patch, let's bring the discussion there.

Again, no need for the paragraph in the tag, I'd say.


Not merged this branch based on the above MTD comments.
