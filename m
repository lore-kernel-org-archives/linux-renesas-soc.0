Subject: [RFC PATCH 0/6] tmio/sdhi: add cmd23 support
Date: Mon,  1 May 2017 11:03:40 +0200
Message-Id: <20170501090346.10801-1-wsa+renesas@sang-engineering.com>

This series adds CMD23 support to SDHI. It was tested on H2 (Gen2, Lager) and
M3W (Gen3, Salvator-X). The test procedure can be found here:

http://elinux.org/Tests:SDHI-CMD23

Patches are based on mmc/next from today. A branch can be found here:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/wsa/linux.git renesas/topic/sdhi-cmd23

The reason these patches are RFC is that they should not be applied right now.
We also have some heavier refactoring going on and it is likely to be better to
apply these patches after the refactoring. However, I send them out now to
encourage review and testing. They do work as expected in my tests.

Thanks and kind regards,

   Wolfram
