Or when deferring probe.

Because the DMA ops might have been set elsewhere than arch_setup_dma_ops(). 
If you look at the patch that added the above warning, its commit message 
states

commit 26b37b946a5c2658dbc37dd5d6df40aaa9685d70 (iommu-joerg/arm/core)

    arm: dma-mapping: Don't override dma_ops in arch_setup_dma_ops()
    
    The arch_setup_dma_ops() function is in charge of setting dma_ops with a
    call to set_dma_ops(). set_dma_ops() is also called from
    
    - highbank and mvebu bus notifiers
    - dmabounce (to be replaced with swiotlb)
    - arm_iommu_attach_device
    
    (arm_iommu_attach_device is itself called from IOMMU and bus master
    device drivers)
    
    To allow the arch_setup_dma_ops() call to be moved from device add time
    to device probe time we must ensure that dma_ops already setup by any of
    the above callers will not be overriden.
    
    Aftering replacing dmabounce with swiotlb, converting IOMMU drivers to
    of_xlate and taking care of highbank and mvebu, the workaround should be
    removed.

I'm concerned about potentially breaking these if we unconditionally remove 
the DMA ops and mapping.
