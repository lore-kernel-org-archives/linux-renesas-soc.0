I don't do it daily, but often, yes. :-)

If you are asking me to keep my next branch immutable, then please no,
I don't like to do that. Reason explained below.

I don't have a problem to share specific renesas mmc branches with
you, if that helps?

I do it for a couple of reasons.

First, sometimes I apply changes before people have provided enough
tested by tags, to instead allow the changes to be tested in
linux-next. This may lead to some situations when I need to re-base my
next branch.
*) Something breaks, then I need to drop the changes. Revert doesn't
play well here, especially if it's a series of changes.
**) Avoid breaking bisect.
***) I want to give people cred, adding peoples tested-by, reviewed-by
tags, after the changes have been queued on my next branch.

Second, even if the changes queued on next has been thoroughly tested,
sometimes error reports still show up. I most cases I prefer to avoid
breaking bisect, which then leaves me in no other option, but
re-basing my branch (to either drop changes or amend them).

I guess what I can do, is to host a pre-next branch, which serves as
my pre-integration branch, before I moves things to next. However,
this does put some more administrative work on me, so I would like to
avoid that.

I am trying to understand the purpose of your renesas integration
tree, and why it's a problem for you to pick up my re-based branch?
Could you perhaps elaborate on this?

Kind regards
Uffe
