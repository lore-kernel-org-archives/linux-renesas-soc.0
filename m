I am still struggling to understand what "EP enters L1 state" means. A
link in L1 means both ends of the link are in electrical idle, it is a
two-way handshake, see PCI express specifications 5.3.2.1 "Entry into
the L1 state".

See above.

That I can understand, I reckon it is to "reset" the RP link state
machine to a "sane" state.

D3 is a device state, not a link state. I still do not understand this
statement.

The link between RP and EP can enter L1 when all functions in the EP
are in a device state != D0 but, as I mentioned above, it is still
unclear what happens in this platform since I do not get what state
in the PCI spec 5.3.2.1 state machine the RP Link state machine is
in.

If we programme the device into any D-state and the device wants to
send a PME message _before_ we reset the RP state machine with the
procedure described in this thread, what happens ? Or, more explicitly,
what are in _HW_ the states of upstream and downstream link state
machines when the EP is put in, say, D1 ?

That's in short our question. I would be happy to get to the bottom
of this since it is an interesting issue we are facing, we need
HW details, I can apply Marek's patch but I would be happier if I get
the whole picture first.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
