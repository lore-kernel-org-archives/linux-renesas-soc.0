Subject: Applied "ASoC: wm8940: Enable cache usage to fix crashes on resume" to the asoc tree

List-ID: <linux-renesas-soc.vger.kernel.org>

The patch

   ASoC: wm8940: Enable cache usage to fix crashes on resume

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: wm8940: Enable cache usage to fix crashes on resume

The wm8940 driver is using a regmap cache sync to restore the
configuration of the chip when switching from OFF to STANDBY, but does
not actually define a register cache which means that the restore is
never going to work and we trigger asserts in regmap.  Fix this by
enabling caching.

Based on commit d3030d11961a8c10 ("ASoC: ak4642: Enable cache usage to
fix crashes on resume") by Mark Brown <broonie@kernel.org>.
