That seems promising but it seems curious that there is no wakeup file.

On Lager the following procedure works for me using
renesas-devel-20160613-v4.7-rc3 and shmobile defconfig.

0. Add wakeup-source property to serial@e6ce0000 node in DT
1. echo enabled > /sys/devices/platform/e6e60000.serial/tty/ttySC0/power/wakeup
2. echo mem > /sys/power/state
3. Provide input on serial console

* Success! *

Great!

Is this resolved? If not perhaps you could consider removing the node
in question for now.
