That's the issue with using wildcards, or truncating part numbers: you
don't know what unrelated future parts may match...

OK.

As the IP cores are the same in all variants, using
"renesas,r7s9210-<something>" should be fine for matching drivers to IP
cores. Same for CONFIG_ARCH_R7S9210.

However, as the actual dies differ between H, M, and L versions, there may
be integration issues to be worked around. So I think it would be wise to
use one more digit in the compatible value at the main SoC level, i.e.
"renesas,r7s92104".
Unless there's a hardware register to detect the version at runtime.
But it seems RZ/A2 doesn't have a Product Register
(PRR), which most other SH/R-Mobile and R-Car SoCs do have?

Thanks!
