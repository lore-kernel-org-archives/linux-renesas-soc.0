Ok, I suspected it was a backward compatibility issue, makes sense.

Ok.

But also, in my reply to Laurent, I brought the idea that there needs to 
be a mechanism in v4l2-core that will take care of this, e.g. 
automatically propagate formats from a sub-device source pad to a 
connected video device. I haven't looked into that idea in more detail 
so there are probably problems to overcome.

Ah, ok, thanks for the warning. I would have run into that issue 
eventually, but now I won'r waste my time :)

Yes, especially because events are not limited to video, they are 
applicable to other kinds of media devices.

Ok, but still it seems alternate -> none is a valid use-case? It allows 
rcar-vin to send unmodified fields to userland, for possible 
de-interlace by FDP1 mem2mem. Or does FDP1 support de-interlacing an 
INTERLACED stream (in addition to de-interlacing a sequential field stream)?

Ok, see above also.
