Correct.

And the PSCI for a particular platform has to respect those
configurations if they powered down the interrupt controller. They need
to read those wakeups and configure the wakeup controller if required.

Also note we can't mark any device as wakeup source in the device tree
in there's dedicated wakeup controller to enable them and main interrupt
controller is powered down.

It's platform specific. The SYSTEM_SUSPEND implementation will be aware
of the platform and it's wakeup configuration. As mention above, it
needs to take some action if required.

OK, that's new to me. I need to read and understand that then. Sorry for
the noise. I was unaware of that.

OK, I will go through that in detail.

But what you are doing is *exactly* same as "freeze" state except the
secondaries powered off instead of idling. So my NACK is mainly for that
reason. Had you done something different, then yes, it should be considered.

I understand that. But tell me how is that any different from the
"freeze" state. Why do you need that new state at all. Again just
because there's a new feature added doesn't mean we need to use it for
sake of using it. If "freeze" != "shallow", then we can explore this
further. But it's not in your case and hence I see no real need for this.
