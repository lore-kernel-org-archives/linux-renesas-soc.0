Hi Fabrizio,

Thank you for the patch.

How about "All other DU instances use one functional clock..." ? I expect more 
entries to the added in the future, it would be nice not to have to modify 
this paragraph.

When there's a single DPAD the table mentions "DPAD" instead of "DPAD 0". 
There's no specific reason for that other than a historical one, but to keep 
entries consistent I would either keep doing so, or rename DPAD to DPAD 0 in 
all existing entries. What would you prefer ?

If you're fine with these changes there's no need to submit a new version, I 
can fix when applying the patch to my tree.
