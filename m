The gyroadc does not have multiple channel inputs, only a single input
pin for serialized data. Supporting multiple channels is done using a
3-bit channel select (CHS) output signal.

In mode 1, the 2 lsb CHS lines are to be connected to the C[01] channel
select pins on the MB88101A.
In other modes, I think you need an external multiplexer to select one of the
8 connected ADCs.

So while you cannot have non-standard channel wirings in mode 1,
you can have a partial (or none at all) multiplexer and less than 8 ADCs,
duplicating data to multiple channels.

Hmm, that can be used to describe duplicated channels, too ;-)
