AFAIU, "renesas,sdhi-r8a77470" would be still used for SDHI0 and SDHI2.

"SDHI1 can also be used as an MMC interface".

Note that this (can also be used as an MMC interface) seems to be true
for the SD card interfaces in R-Car Gen3, too.

So either
  a) SDHI0/2 vs. SDHI1 are different, deserving different compatible values, or
  b) SDHI0/1/2 are identical, but SDHI1 is wired different, deserving the same
     compatible value, but one or more additional properties describing the
     different wiring.

Wolfram's proposal for b) was looking at the (lack of) dmas properties, but
that's not sufficient, as they are optional anyway.
