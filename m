The issue is backward compatibility. The original driver targeted 
Renesas Gen2 board which was relatively simple and might even pre-date 
the media controller api. When I extended the diver to support Gen3 
boards which are more complex I had to add media controller support to 
the driver. There is a huge overlap (rcar-dma.c) between Gen2 and Gen3 
and it seemed silly to have two drivers.

As a side note Jacopo added support for the parallel node in the media 
controller for Gen3 boards which have the same pipeline as Gen2. So 
everything needed to remove the none MC code paths are in the driver but 
I'm afraid that would upset current users on Gen2 ;-)

I agree V4L2_EVENT_SOURCE_CHANGE could be a nice way of doing this if 
the event routing is sorted out.

It might solve the event routing problem but will create others. For 
example each VIN instance can have a private notifier if it has a 
parallel subdevice and be part of VIN group for the ones coming from 
CSI-2.

I think this is the right way to go.

I think you are correct Kieran, we now have the scratch buffer so it 
should be possible to add proper support for delivering ALTERNATING to 
userspace. I'm sure we find new issues on the way tho ;-)

My bad I should have said using instead of abusing, sorry about that :-) 
I did not know that this was a valid use-case for FIELD_NONE so yes I 
think it could be used if we can't solve the requirements for adding 
ALTERNATING.
