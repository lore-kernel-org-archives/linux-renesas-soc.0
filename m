Basically boils down to whether the conversion is linear or not.  Doesn't
strictly speaking havie antyhing to do with whether it is computed from
a number of inputs or not. If the conversion is linear then leave it to
userspace (_raw and _scale + _offset if needed).  If it's non linear we
have no way to describe it so we have to do it in kernel and use _processed.

However, another element applies.  If either the scale or offset is not
independent of the reading (i.e. we can't cache a value indefinitely in
userspace code and expect it not to change unless userspace asks it to)
then we should wrap that up in the kernel and just used a processed output
directly. Otherwise userspace can not be sure it got a valid set of values
from which to compute the real reading.

My issue is that the wrapper adds code that needs to be reviewed, with no
actual benefit given it's a direct and simple call to the i2c core.

That protects the bus, but not a interacting sequences like this.  Could
easily have two running in parallel.

Two crossed bits of review here.  If it had been the case that raw and
scale were fixed then having this made no sense.  As it turns out the
opposite is true, so we should not have raw output for any channels where
the scale might change.  Sorry I should have cleaned this comment up
after I understood what was going on in more detail.
