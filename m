Oh yes the external device certainly needs to be described. As it is 
controlled through a separate, general-purpose I2C or SPI controller, it 
should be a child node of that controller. The DRIF handles the data interface 
only, not the control interface of the external device.

CC'ing Maxime Ripard for the sun8i side.
