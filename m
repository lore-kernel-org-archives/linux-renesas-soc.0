Hi Geert, everyone,

Do you have any opinion about the code in this version of the series?

I recall that you agreed with the approach in "[PATCH/RFC 2/2]
iommu/ipmmu-vmsa: Opt-in slave devices based on ES version", however
it was suggested to me by Robin that my code in "[PATCH/RFC 1/2]
arm64: mm: Silently allow devices lacking IOMMU group" should be
reworked to use ->xlate().

Now this series makes use of ->xlate() to implement the white list, so
I hope that makes everyone happy.

Also, based on your suggestion I finally managed to break out the code
that skips over disabled devices in "[PATCH/RFC v2 1/4] iommu/of: Skip
IOMMU devices disabled in DT" but I'm not sure if this will cause
problem for other platforms.

Anyway, my current plan is to wait for feedback for "[PATCH/RFC v2
1/4] iommu/of: Skip IOMMU devices disabled in DT" and handle that
independently, and also roll in the other changes in this series into
my other IPMMU code.

Thanks,

/ magnus
