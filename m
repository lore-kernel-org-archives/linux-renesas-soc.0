The answer is very simple, the GIC driver doesn't give a damn about the
second part of the GICH region, because it is absolutely unusable for
any realistic use-case. Only the banked version of GICH is of any
relevance (the first 512 bytes, in essence).

Aligning the GIC regions on 64kB boundaries is documented in the SBSA
specification, independently of the GIC400 documentation.
