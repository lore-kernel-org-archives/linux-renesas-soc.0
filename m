By PM methods I included runtime PM (and related device dependencies)
but you are right there, I missed some use cases (which are not
necessarily the most common but we have to cope with them anyway).

Yep, see above, I do not like it but I do not see how we can solve it
in another way either.

That's for Marek to explain and the explanation has to go along
with this discussion in the resulting commit log.
