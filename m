I'm all for consistency, but...

That's a stray newline in both drivers/pinctrl/sh-pfc/pfc-r8a7795-es1.c and
drivers/pinctrl/sh-pfc/pfc-r8a7796.c, which should be removed from the latter
instead.

drivers/pinctrl/sh-pfc/pfc-r8a7795-es1.c has a newline here because H3 ES1.x
doesn't have the fifth set of MSIOF pins, thus msiof3_rxd_d_mux() is the
last entry of the MSIOF section.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
