Not easily :) - Except for the 'main' address (0x70), these are not
addresses documented by the datasheet. <by the very nature of the
activity>. The driver supports the DT providing the slave pages to
allocate. One day the I2C framework might allow us to 'request' an
unused page :D

I performed a scan on the Salvator-X, (i2cdetect -r -y 4) and identified
a region of unused I2C address space to allocate the 12 pages so that
they did not conflict.

In particular, the address <0x30> which is the default for the CBUS page
conflicts with the default address of the OV10635 used by the GMSL
cameras on the same bus, and so I needed to move that one.

To make the effects clear, (and the i2cdetect reporting more obvious) I
chose to reassign all of the movable pages so that it is clear they are
from the same device.

Rather annoyingly it's difficult to map a slave page back to it's driver
due to the fact that it gets registered as a 'dummy' driver, so keeping
the related addresses together is quite valuable.

As soon as I get some free cycles, I plan to look at being able to map
extra driver information to dummy I2C registrations to make it easier to
identify who owns the address :)
