Hi,

This series adds support for for using CPUFreq as a cooling device for
the A57 CUP:s on Renesas H3 and M3-W SoC:s. It depends on Simon Horman's
topic/rcar-gen3-cpufreq-v4 branch [1] and is tested on H3 and M3-W. For 
test results and test procedure please see:

   http://elinux.org/R-Car/Tests:rcar_gen3_thermal

Few notes on the specific values used in this series and why they might
need to be changed.

- The trip point temperature of 95000 used is the most conservative one
  from the BSP and maybe should be set at 110000 which is the most
  aggressive one in the BSP.

- The cooling states described in all cooling-maps nodes might be
  subject to change depending on the out-come of the ongoing review
  process of Simon's work. It should use the highest possible cooling
  state so if the number of states change due review of his work this
  should be reflected in this series.

* Changes since v1
- Added acks from Eduardo Valentin.
- Rebased on top of the latest branch of Simons work.
