I am also reluctant to add "renesas,rcar-gen3-sdhi", because as we are
seeing things are not so simple wrt to compatible.

Can I clarify the proposal regarding "renesas,sdhi-mmc-r8a77470",
would it be as well as or instead of "renesas,sdhi-r8a77470" ?

And what is signified by "mmc" that is not implied by (some of the)
existing compat strings?


Perhaps stating the obvious: this feels a lot like the problem we thought
we had with different Gen-3 SoCs/ES versions. And in that case we decided
against using compat strings to differentiate. The main difference here
seems to be that we need to differentiate between different ports on the
same SoC.
