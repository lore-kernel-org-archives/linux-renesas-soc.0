Subject: [PATCH/RFT v2 0/8] Add SDHI to r8a7796/salvator-x
Date: Tue, 23 Aug 2016 09:49:42 +0200

Hi,

this patch set updates drivers, documentation and DT to
enable SDHI0 & 3 on the r8a7796/salvator-x. This includes
defining nodes for all available SDHI and GPIO devices.

I have boot-tested this which seems successful.
However, I do not have physical access to an r8a7796/salvator-x board
and the one that I have remote access to does not appear to have
any SD cards present. I would be grateful of any testing anyone
can provide.

Based on renesas-drivers-2016-08-09-v4.8-rc1

Provided for testing as the topic/r8a7796-sdhi-v2 branch in
my renesas tree on kernel.org.

Changes since v1 noted in individual changelogs.
Acks from v1 also added.
