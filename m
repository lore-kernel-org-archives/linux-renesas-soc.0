/sys/devices/platform/soc/ee080000.usb
/sys/devices/platform/soc/ee0c0000.usb
/sys/devices/platform/soc/ee0a0000.usb

Driver: ohci-platform

The children are usb6/6-0:1.0, usb3/3-0:1.0, resp. usb4/4-0:1.0, all using
the usb "hub" driver

/sys/devices/platform/soc/ee080200.usb-phy
/sys/devices/platform/soc/ee0a0200.usb-phy
/sys/devices/platform/soc/ee0c0200.usb-phy

Driver: phy_rcar_gen3_usb2

The children are:

phy/phy-ee080200.usb-phy.2
phy/phy-ee0a0200.usb-phy.0
phy/phy-ee0c0200.usb-phy.1

all without a driver, according to sysfs.

Note that at first I had missed them, as printing the children using
device_for_each_child() does not print them, unlike the hub devices that
are children of the usb hosts.

With some debug code added, logging inc/dec of child_count:

USB driver init:

parent ee080200.usb-phy
+phy phy-ee080200.usb-phy.2: rpm_resume:759: inc child_count of parent
ee080200.usb-phy

Somehow the phy class phy-ee0*0200.usb-phy.* devices have the platform
ee0*0200.usb-phy devices as parent, but they're not part of the list of
children? Looks like a bug in the USB PHY driver or subsystem.


USB hub instantiation:

+usb usb6: rpm_suspend:606: dec child_count of parent ee080000.usb


System suspend:

+usb usb6: rpm_resume:830: inc child_count of parent ee080000.usb
