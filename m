IC. I incorrectly assumed it would be the number of cells after a pinctrl
phandle, which is superfluous here as these are subnodes of the pfc node.

That's indeed a bit of twisting ;-)

You can fix that by keeping the RZ_PIN() macro, and changing it to e.g.

#define RZ_PIN(bank, pin)     ((bank) << 16 | (pin))
