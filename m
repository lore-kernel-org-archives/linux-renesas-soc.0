Maybe there's something I don't get, but pm_genpd_prepare() ends with

        /*
         * The PM domain must be in the GPD_STATE_ACTIVE state at this point,
         * so genpd_poweron() will return immediately, but if the device
         * is suspended (e.g. it's been stopped by genpd_stop_dev()), we need
         * to make it operational.
         */
        pm_runtime_resume(dev);
        __pm_runtime_disable(dev, false);

        ret = pm_generic_prepare(dev);
        if (ret) {
                ... /* irrelevant error handling */
        }

        pm_runtime_put(dev);
        return ret;

The device is thus resumed. Note that the pm_runtime_put() call will decrease 
the usage count that was increased at the beginning of the function (and thus 
makes pm_genpd_prepare() neutral from a usage count point of view) but won't 
resume the device as the disable depth is increased by __pm_runtime_disable().

As far as I understand, the device is thus effectively active when entering 
the driver's system suspend handler, with a usage count equal to 1 or more. 
pm_runtime_force_suspend(), which decides whether to suspend the device based 
on the device pm state and not the usage count, will thus always pm suspend 
the device.

Is the above analysis correct ?

Now I'm a bit lost as to what happens (and what should happen) at resume time. 
Does genpd and the PM core try to suspend the device after calling the 
driver's resume handler (pm_runtime_force_resume() in this case) under some 
conditions, or does the resume handler have the last word in deciding the PM 
runtime status of the device after system resume ?

That I agree with.
