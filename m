I don't think listing the marketing names is a problem if we need a
full list of all chips in of_device_ids anyway.

I'm still hoping to be able to limit the need for specifying the
register addresses in the driver instead.

Ok, so for R-Car H1, I assume we don't need the driver, it would just
be a way to replace the current workaround with a different one, right?

For R-Car H3, do we just require driver changes to work with ES2.0,
or also DT changes? If the new chip version already implies a new DT,
we can require the presence of a device node that has the correct
register number.
