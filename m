Yes, we have to, as pm_runtime_force_suspend() is widely deployed. Or
are you saying we should just ignore all issues related to it?

Of course, if we had something that could replace
pm_runtime_force_suspend(), that would be great, but there isn't.

There is different ways to solve this, for sure. I picked this one,
because I think it's the most trivial thing to do, and it shouldn't
cause any other problems.

I think any other option would involve assigning ->suspend|resume()
callbacks to the phy core device, but that's fine too, if you prefer
that.

Also, I have considered how to deal with wakeup paths for phys,
although I didn't want to post changes as a part of this series, but
maybe I should to give a more complete picture?

Kind regards
