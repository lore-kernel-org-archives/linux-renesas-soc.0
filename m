Could you kindly share an example for this? Looking into the H3 and the 
M3-W manual, it looks to me that ~90% (?) of the peripherals are the same.

I'd propose to do it correct from the beginning.

Doing it later would either be more work or forgotten, and never be 
done, then.

For a starting point, I'd propose to put the r8a7795.dtsi and 
r8a7796.dtsi into a graphical diff tool and move all common parts to a 
rcar3.dtsi (I'd be happy to discuss the name, though)

Best regards

Dirk
