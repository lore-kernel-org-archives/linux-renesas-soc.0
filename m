I hacked my RZ/A DMA driver, not the SDCARD driver. I assume you are=20
using R-Car, so that driver already uses a threaded IRQ handler (not a
tasklet).

But, what I did not try yet was rewriting the patch for SDHI=20
(52ad9a8e854c) so that instead of using wait_for_completion() in the callba=
ck, it=20
creates a kernel thread to do the waiting. In that case, the DMA tasklet=20
would complete immediately and my DMA driver could remain using tasklets
instead of threaded irqs.

I am worried about the scheduling latencies of using a kernel thread for
the SDHI callback, but, I guess that's no different than using a=20
threaded irq handler.

However...I'm wondering if I'm missing something obvious here and doing=20
extra work for nothing.
