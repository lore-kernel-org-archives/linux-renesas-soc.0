Subject: [PATCH v4 i2c/for-next] i2c: rcar: Add per-Generation fallback bindings
Date: Fri,  2 Dec 2016 15:25:36 +0100
Message-Id: <1480688736-7175-1-git-send-email-horms+renesas@verge.net.au>
Sender: devicetree-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-renesas-soc.vger.kernel.org>

In the case of Renesas R-Car hardware we know that there are generations of
SoCs, e.g. Gen 2 and Gen 3. But beyond that it's not clear what the
relationship between IP blocks might be. For example, I believe that
r8a7790 is older than r8a7791 but that doesn't imply that the latter is a
descendant of the former or vice versa.

We can, however, by examining the documentation and behaviour of the
hardware at run-time observe that the current driver implementation appears
to be compatible with the IP blocks on SoCs within a given generation.

For the above reasons and convenience when enabling new SoCs a
per-generation fallback compatibility string scheme is being adopted for
drivers for Renesas SoCs.

Also:
* Deprecate renesas,i2c-rcar. It seems poorly named as it is only
  compatible with R-Car Gen 1. It also appears unused in mainline.
* Add some text to describe per-SoC bindings

---
v4
* Correct grammar in changelog

v3
* Consistently use renesas,<family>-<module> for new compat strings
* Drop RFC designation

v2
* Include accidently omitted i2c-rcar.c portion of patch
