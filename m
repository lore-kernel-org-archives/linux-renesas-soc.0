Subject: [PATCH v5 0/7] PM / Domains: Add DT bindings for the R-Car System Controller
Date: Wed, 13 Apr 2016 16:44:16 +0200

	Hi Simon, Magnus,

This patch series introduces DT bindings for the R-Car System
Controller, as found on Renesas R-Car H1, R-Car Gen2, and R-Car Gen3
SoCs.

Changes compared to v4:
  - Add Reviewed-by,
  - Remove power-domains property from the sysc node again, as the
    System Controller itself is not part of the Clock Domain.

Changes compared to v3:
  - Add Reviewed-by, Acked-by,
  - Compatible value must contain "exactly one" instead of "one or
    more",
  - Add power-domains property to refer to the SoC's Clock Domain,
  - Drop R8A7779_PD_SH, as it's not documented in the datasheet,
  - Rename R8A779*_PD_SH to R8A779*_PD_SH_4A on R-Car Gen2,
  - Add always-on power area on R-Car H1 and R-Car Gen2,
  - Use numbers directly on R-Car M2-N, to make the header file
    self-contained.

Changes compared to v2:
  - Move power area hierarchy from DT to C (cfr. DT bindings for Renesas
    CPG/MSSR), and switch to "#power-domain-cells = <1>",
  - Drop fallback compatibility strings, as the bindings are
    SoC-specific,
  - Drop power area A3SH on R-Car H3, as it's no longer
    documented in the datasheet, and touching it seems to crash SYSC,
  - Add an "always-on" power area on R-Car H3,
  - Rename from renesas,sysc-rcar.txt to renesas,rcar-sysc.txt,
  - Extract bindings into a separate series (was "[PATCH/RFC v2 00/11]
    ARM/arm64: renesas: Add SYSC PM Domain DT Support",
    http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg483199.html).

Changes compared to v1:
  - Add R-Car H3 (r8a7795) support,
  - Use "renesas,<type>-sysc" instead of "renesas,sysc-<type>",
  - Add fallback compatibility strings for R-Car Gen2 and Gen3.

Thanks for appplying!
