Note that the platform (through genpd?) also matters.
The same device may need to be kept enabled on one platform to generate
wakeup events, and may generate such events while disabled on another
platform.

OK. Looking forward to it...

OK. That can definitely be done.

drivers/soc/mediatek/mtk-scpsys.c and drivers/soc/rockchip/pm_domains.c
seem to use a more complex callback, but it looks like it can be simplified to
a boolean flag, too.

Thanks!
