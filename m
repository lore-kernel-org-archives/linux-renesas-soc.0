Great! Thanks!

On naming: if we need "output-buffer-enable" should we add
"input-buffer-enable" as well?

Currently we are using "input-enable" to pair with "output-enable",
but as you said, just "output-enable" when "output-high" and
"output-low" are there already seems a bit confusing.
At the same time "input-buffer-enable" seems to actually be just
electrically equivalent to "input-enable", so adding it is a bit of a
waste as well.

I see three options here:

1) Add "output-buffer-enable" and "input-buffer-enable"
we end up with
"output-high"
"output-low"
"input-enable"
"output-buffer-enable"
"input-buffer-enable"

2) Add "output-buffer-enable" only
we end up with
"output-high"
"output-low"
"input-enable"
"output-buffer-enable"

Binding may be confusing as in one case we use "output-buffer-enable"
while in the other "input-enable"

3) Add "output-enable" only
"output-high"
"output-low"
"input-enable"
"output-enable"

As you, I don't like "output-enable" that much but it pairs better with
"input-enable".

I'll let you and DT people decide on this, as it's really an ABI definition
problem and you have better judgment there.

Thank you. Didn't want to put pressure ;)

Not a mess, and thanks for your effort in maintaining  all of this

Thanks
