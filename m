But what drivers/ssb/pcihost_wrapper.c does is just wrong!

I guess we'd need a special variant of pci_prepare_to_sleep() with an
extra "wakeup" arg for it to do the right thing and I don't see why it
cannot do all that in ->suspend_late.

I'm not inclined to believe it until I see a convincing example. :-)

And it obviously won't take the later updates of power.wakeup_path into account.

Anyway, for the time being please at least add a comment next to the
first invocation of this routine to explain why it is needed in there.

Which means that the parent's direct_complete is only cleared when it
is unset already, so this isn't incorrect, but just pointless.

Well, "pointless" doesn't really sound good to me too ...

Yes, please.

Apart from avoiding a pointless update of the parent's direct_complete
I think that it's better to keep it close to the update of
direct_complete for suppliers.

Thanks,
