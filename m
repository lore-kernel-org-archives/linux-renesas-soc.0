Yes, this should be safe from the NULL pointer checks perspective.

That depends on what happens during hibernation/restore.

The driver may not need to do anything before the memory snapshot is taken or
before the restore kernel jumps back to the image kernel.  In that case you
don't need freeze/thaw/restore_noirq at all.

However, chances are that it needs to do something and in that case doing
the same thing as during system-wide suspend/resume generally works, even
though it may not be particularly energy-efficient.  That's why it very
ofther is done.
