Hi,

This series add iommu support to rcar-dmac. It's tested on Koelsch with
CONFIG_IPMMU_VMSA and by enabling the ipmmu_ds node in r8a7791.dtsi. I verified
operation by interacting with /dev/mmcblk1  which is a device behind the iommu.

The series depends on out of tree patch '[PATCH] dmaengine: use phys_addr_t for
slave configuration' which Vinod now have moved forward whit, thanks!

* Changes since v3
- Folded in a fix from Robin to his patch.
- Added a check to make sure dma_map_resource can not be used to map RAM as
  pointed out by Robin. I use BUG_ON to enforce this. It might not be the best
  method but I saw no other good way since DMA_ERROR_CODE might not be defined
  on all platforms.
- Added comment about that DTS changes will disable 2 DMA channels due to a HW
  (?) but in the DMAC.
- Dropped the use of dma_attrs, no longer needed.
- Collected Acked-by and Reviewed-by from Laurent.
- Various indentation fix ups.

* Changes since v2
- Drop patch to add dma_{map,unmap}_page_attrs.
- Add dma_{map,unmap}_resource to handle the mapping without involving a
  'struct page'. Thanks Laurent and Robin for pointing this out.
- Use size instead of address to keep track of if a mapping exist or not
  since addr == 0 is valid. Thanks Laurent.
- Pick up patch from Robin with Laurents ack (hope it's OK for me to
  attach the ack?) to add IOMMU_MMIO.
- Fix bug in rcar_dmac_device_config where the error check where
  inverted.
- Use DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL in rcar_dmac_device_config since we at that
  point can't be sure what direction the mapping is going to be used.

* Changes since v1
- Add and use a dma_{map,unmap}_page_attrs to be able to map the page
  using attributes DMA_ATTR_NO_KERNEL_MAPPING and
  DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC. Thanks Laurent.
- Drop check if dmac is part of a iommu group or not, let the DMA
  mapping api handle it.
- Move slave configuration data around in rcar-dmac to avoid code
  duplication.
- Fix build issue reported by 'kbuild test robot' regarding phys_to_page
  not availability on some configurations.
- Add DT information for r8a7791.

* Changes since RFC
- Switch to use the dma-mapping api instead of using the iommu_map()
  directly. Turns out the dma-mapper is much smarter then me...
- Dropped the patch to expose domain->ops->pgsize_bitmap from within the
  iommu api.
- Dropped the patch showing how I tested the RFC.
