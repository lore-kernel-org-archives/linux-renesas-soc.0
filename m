Is this something we expect to see more of in the future, or can
we expect future chips to handle this more consistently?

Do you have a specific example in mind? If this is only a theoretical
problem, we can worry about it when we get there, and then decide
if we add a hardcoded register after all.

Fair enough, that is more than I was expecting from looking at the
source. It's probably the of_device_id structures for the most part.

Please just add the __maybe_unused then, to save us a patch in case
we make -Wunused-const the default in the future.
