Yes, that should work too.

"interrupt-names" is handy for DTS writers, so they don't have to look up the
order in the bindings, and it's less likely they make mistakes in the
order of the
interrupts.

However, as soon as there will be an SoC where you will need a "hole"
in the list,
you're gonna need interrupt-names anyway.
