You need the #address-cells and #size-cells properties in the ports node, but 
as they're already added by the SoC .dtsi, you don't need to duplicate them 
here.

No reason, the same comment applies to HDMI too :-)

My point was that it seems a bit pointless to define a node and extend it with 
additional properties in the same file, when you could merge those properties 
in the node definition. You only need to extend nodes with additional 
properties when they're defined in one file and extended in another one.

The properties are needed, why should you remove them ? :-)
