But USB peripheral is a different driver. So, this code will not run. So
USB2_COMMCTRL will keep the default value 0x80000000.

Correct?

If a board is designed for USB peripheral, why would they enable a EHCI=20
host driver for the same USB channel?
I am confused.

Today for RZ/A1, we tell people to use USB0 first in their board design,
then use USB1 if they need a second USB channel. USB pins are dedicated
(no other function) so there should be no design conflicts.

If only USB1 is used, USB0 must also be enabled in DT as a dummy driver=20
(so SYSCFG.UPLLE can get set for USB1).

Yes.
