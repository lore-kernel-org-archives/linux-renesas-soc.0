I'm mostly interested in this series as it allows me to add data lane
negotiation at run time. In my case, there are no stream continuity
constraints, but I get your point here.

Personally, I would say that your muxer driver, if able to switch
source without requiring a pipeline restart, should handle it
internally. There are specific details that the mux should be able to
handle, and we're still pretty vague on the details. As a start, which
is the bus type your sources connects to the muxer with? Parallel?
CSI-2? How is the video stream multiplexed? with CSI-2 VC? Do you need
to control your source power during inactive period? I'm sure there
are more questions... I agree a partial pipeline restart might be
something to consider, but at the same time I think this is not
something strictly required to get this series merged, isn't it?

Thanks
