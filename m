Subject: [PATCH] MAINTAINERS: update entry for TMIO MMC driver
Date: Mon,  9 May 2016 10:26:58 +0200

From: Wolfram Sang <wsa+renesas@sang-engineering.com>

I have some more additions planned for this driver, so I'd like to get
notified of other changes and coordinate them. Drop Ian as maintainer
because he hasn't been involved in development for a while. Thanks for
all the initial work, of course! Also, reflect the recent changes to
the include file layout.

Ian: If you'd like to stay involved, please speak up and I'll change my patch
accordingly.
