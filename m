I dropped this in v3.

OK, I cleaned up RXRDY | TXRQ in renesas drivers, too.

It is probably possible to cleanup DATAEND,
but I did not touch it for now.

As you may know, the original IP from Panasonic
did not support internal DMAC.

Renesas extended the IP by itself for the internal DMAC.

Panasonic did so in a different way.  So, the DMA engine HW
is completely different, and the current core is not
flexible enough for UniPhier SoCs because
our DMA engines added own interrupt masks.

I will consider how to handle it later,
but I do not see a reason to do it in this series.

I cleaned up force_pio, but in a separate patch
because it is just loosely related.

I could not understand this suggestion.
Please let me know if v3 is still a problem.
