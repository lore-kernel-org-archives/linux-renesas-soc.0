Unfortunately no.

For example that would break drivers/ssb/pcihost_wrapper.c, as it uses
the flag from its ->suspend() callback.

Also, I expect there may be more cases when the flag may be useful to
check from a ->suspend() callback, rather than from a ->suspend_late()
(or in later phase).

That is already taken care of in __device_suspend_late(), with the below check:

        if (dev->power.syscore || dev->power.direct_complete)
                goto Complete;

 In other words, the dpm_propagate_to_parent() isn't called when
dev->power.direct_complete is set.

I can do this, if you think this is more clear, but according to the
above, it's shouldn't be needed.

Kind regards
