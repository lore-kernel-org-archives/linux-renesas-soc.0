Bummer. You're right. It's actually due to that commit.

I searched in my gmail for a patch with the specific title, and blindly
replied to the first match, not noticing that was not the right patch.
Sorry for that.

On R-Car Gen3, there's no change in PMU related messages.
Actual PMU messages are:

    hw perfevents: enabled with armv8_cortex_a57 PMU driver, 7
counters available
    hw perfevents: /soc/pmu_a53: failed to probe PMU!
    hw perfevents: /soc/pmu_a53: failed to register PMU devices!

The last two are due to the CA53 cores being described in DT, but not
enabled in the firmware.

On SH-Mobile AG5 (sh73a0/kzm9g), it recently (not due to the bad commit)
started printing:

   +hw perfevents: no interrupt-affinity property for /pmu, guessing.
    hw perfevents: enabled with armv7_cortex_a9 PMU driver, 7 counters available

which looks related.

Thanks!
