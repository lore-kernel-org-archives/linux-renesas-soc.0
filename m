Hi Kuninori,

I have no plan.
My Cubox machine has too many specific code and it is used in an organ
as the sound synthesizer. I will not do any more development in its
kernel.
In my new machine, an Orange PI 2, while audio on HDMI is working for
me, there is still a lot of job to do aside (YUV video, analog
audio, embedded wifi...) and I am blocked by the HDMI driver which has
no free license nor documentation about the hardware. So, I have not
submitted yet a patch series about audio for this machine.

Otherwise, if you read the previous discussions, I think the most
important is Mark's remark (Sat, 7 Feb 2015 16:33:55 +0800 in the
alsa-devel mailing-list):
