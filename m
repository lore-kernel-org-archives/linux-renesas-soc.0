Probably no.

The original IP from Panasonic did not contain any internal DMA engine.

renesas_sdhi_internal_dmac.c is probably
the Resansas' own extension.


Panasonic also implemented a different internal DMA engine
(Socionext inherited the RTL from Panasonic).

This is completely different from the Renesas' implementation.

I do not mind that, but the file name would be very long
"tmio_mmc_renesas_sdhi_internal_dmac.c"

Or, do you mean "tmio_mmc_renesas_internal_dmac.c" ?



> 2. Are there other SoCs using an external DMAC?


Yes.  Some old SoCs in UniPhier SoC family rely on
the external DMAC, like renesas_sdhi_sys_dmac.c

"sdhi" is already Renesas-specific name, isn't it?

I really do not care, "sys" or "external"
It is up to renesas folks .


>    If not, perhaps the "renesas" should be kept in the driver name?


I am not quite sure, but this is less Renesas-specific
since renesas_sdhi_sys_dmac.c is just a software abstraction layer.
The real driver code is under drivers/dma/.

The difference is, in my case, TX and RX share a single DMA channel.


Thanks.
