Do you have UHS-SDIO cards? Otherwise, some more testing in Spain will
be good.

I don't think so. We'd need more test coverage. My gut feeling is that
it varies from board to board. Or more precisely: from environment
around the board to environment around the board. I'd like to test a)
more boards) and b) a resoldered WLAN card to skip the extra cabling
there. I still think the wire length of ~23cm (exceeding the spec of max
10cm) is a factor here, so resoldering would save ~6cm. That all sounds
to me like a hacking sprint for our next meeting.

Maybe ULCB has less line lengths? Would be interesting to check, too.

I could also try to apply more shielding here at home, too.

Not nice, yes. Yet, until this thread, there have been no issues
reported. So, it doesn't look like a substantial fault to me (famous
last words?)
