They're not really created by cp & sed, as they must match the table in the
datasheet (the latter may have been created by copy & paste though :-)

The point is these files are stable ABI: no single value can be changed.
No value can be reused. Only new values can be appended at the bottom
(if a newer revision of the datasheet documents more clocks than the old
 version, which happens from time to time).

IMHO a hierarchical way of defining the clocks has more opportunity of
accidentally referring to a clock that doesn't exist on a particular SoC.

Furthermore, r8a779x-cpg-mssr.h is not a good name to be part of a DT binding,
due to the wildcard.
A future SoC may will match r8a779x and even be called (R-Car <something>3?),
while using a completely different CPG block.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
