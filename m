I have a hunch (without too much digging) that this may be an odd
interaction with the direct_complete stuff since the simple-pm-bus has
no callbacks.

For kicks, could you add something like the hack below (untested) which
will avoid the direct_complete path, and at least help indicate if
that path is worth investigating further.

Thanks,

Kevin
