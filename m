OK, thanks!

It also would be good to know the topology of the device hierarchy and
how that maps to the domains on the failing system (and which UART
clocks are operated by genpd).

Hmm.  I overlooked that part.

This is sort of unusual, because the driver doesn't provide any
runtime PM callbacks, but still it does provided system suspend ones.
It looks like the idea is to never put it into runtime suspend if any
ports are enabled and always put it into runtime suspend otherwise.

Which one is the case in your testing?  Is the port disabled or
enabled during system-wide suspend?

What does this point to for that particular device?
