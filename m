Hi,

R-Car Gen2 have two DMA controllers, which are equivalent. However DMA
slaves were tied only to a single DMA controller in .dtsi. This series
add references to to both DMA controllers for all nodes that previously
only referenced one of them. It also adds dma references to the SDHI
nodes for r8a7794 which according to the datasheet should work but I
have not access to HW to verify.

Tested on Koelsch (r8a7791) by altering the compatible value of either
dmac0 or dmac1 and verifying that the DMA slaves pick the DMA controller
that is instantiated.
