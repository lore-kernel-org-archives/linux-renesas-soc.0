I appologise that this pull-request has turned out to be hard to digest.

I think that one reason for this is that there are an unusally large number
of commits. It seems that the team has been a little more productive than
usual and I might have been better to send a smaller pull-request earlier
in the development cycle and then follow-up with a second batch. I'll try
to pay more attention to this aspect of things going forwards.

Regarding your specific comments:

* Repetition of SoCs. I do try to group things in a logical manner,
  but clearly I failed in this case. I'll try to make that a bit clearer
  in future.

* Verbosity: There as a request a few development cycles for me
  to include more information in the commit logs. It seems that
  I may have gone a bit too far. I'll try to find a better balance next
  time around.

* Patches for the same change split up for different SoCs/boards.
  Featurs broken out into incremental patches. And so on.

  This has been a long-standing practice for Renesas SoC development.
  We find that in general it aids review. It also works well
  with the way we develop patches. But I do see your point that
  it may be a little excessive - f.e. multiple patches for the same
  whitespace fixes. Again, we'll try to find a better balance.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help make this happen.
This work is very important to Renesas.
