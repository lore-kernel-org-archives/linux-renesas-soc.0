May be, may be not.

single driver.

I'm trying to unify the drivers little by little and there are hundred
of them.

It is not the first time we face this situation and Bartosz Golaszewski
has a similar problem [1].

We have all the frameworks we need to solve this properly but I would
like something we can propagate to all drivers (OF and !OF) so we end up
with unified code.

It is time we clearly state the dependency issues and we find a proper
way to solve it.
