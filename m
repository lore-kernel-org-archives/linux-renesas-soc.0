These patches look good to me. My assumption is that they
can be applied without causing any breakage and that the
relevant features will start working once driver support
shows up in the kernel.

If the above assumption is correct then please let me know when the
bindings have been accepted by the relevant subsystem maintainer(s).

If the patches need rebasing at that time then please repost them.
Otherwise you can either repost them or ping me as a response to this thread.

Thanks!
