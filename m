Oh, I didn't think about this at all, anymore. Though I believe to
remember that this was the reason that I checked for
(gpiod_get_direction(pb->enable_gpio) == GPIOF_DIR_OUT) before, so ...

... I'm in favor of the latter, as this is closer to the initial
intention. I'd also mention this in the comment:

       /*
        * If the GPIO is not known to be already configured as output, that is,
        * if gpiod_get_direction returns either GPIOF_DIR_IN or -EINVAL, change
        * the direction to output and set the GPIO as active.
        * Do not force the GPIO to active when it was already output as it
        * could cause backlight flickering or we would enable the backlight too
        * early. Leave the decision of the initial backlight state for later.
        */
