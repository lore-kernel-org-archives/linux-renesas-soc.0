We can't really do that for the existing SoCs as the concept of groups is 
present in the hardware. Not only do we need to select per-pin functions, but 
there are also register bits that perform pin muxing for whole groups. If this 
changes in future generations of the SoCs we then could do away with the data 
tables, but for now we're stuck with them.
