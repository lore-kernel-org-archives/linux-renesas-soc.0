Hi Jean,

Why? Well, it doesn't matter anymore but what is wrong with limiting the
variable like this?

Either both in parens, or none ;) But doesn't matter as well anymore.

SCCB defines addresses to be 7 bit.

Ehrm, probably I was just too tied to the ordering of "first start -
then data - then stop - then next loop" :)

No, I did miss it.

A lot better! I like it very much. And also

Do you want to cook up a patch or shall I? I'd just need a SoB then.

Thanks for the improvement!
