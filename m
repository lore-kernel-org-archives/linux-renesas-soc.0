The commit message mentions that the patch is supposed to fix some
issue on the Salvator-XS board. I found the following from a year ago
https://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg457308.html
which is also about PHY reset and this board. Is there still something
open?  But as Andrew mentioned already: Just deleting code w/o
checking what it's good for and whether this could have side effects,
isn't a solution. Especially because the patch would silently remove
the call to phy_scan_fixups().
