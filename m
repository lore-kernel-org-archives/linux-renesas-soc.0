Hi Robin, Shimoda-san, everyone,

Thanks for your feedback!

I agree, this flag was added without too much consideration about
correct location.

You are absolutely right. My apologies for not providing more
information in the first place.

Like you mention, the workaround can not be made into something
general purpose, however for some restricted use case it might be
helpful. For instance, we have some MMC controllers that are able to
perform on-chip bus mastering but they lack scatter gather support.
>From the hardware design point of view the scatter gather feature was
decided to be put into the IPMMU hardware. Because of that we would
like to use the IPMMU hardware for this purpose, however with some ES
specific errata we need to handle unmapping in a special way.
Fortunately the MMC controllers are grouped together using the same
IPMMU and we are able to make sure that all the buffers are unmapped
now and then from a workaround in the MMC device driver. Not pretty
but not super intrusive.

Yeah, suspend/resume or unbind/bind might work.

It's not. =)

There is room for improvement in the implementation for sure! We also
had other ideas of tracking mapped pages per device instead of per
domain. We have other requirements from the hardware to serialize some
MMC data handling, so grouping the MMC devices together into a single
IOMMU domain seemed light weight and simple for a first shot!

I think the code assumes that __free_iova_domain() is used instead of
__free_iova(), and in such case I believe it should be safe as long as
the flag force_reset_when_empty is set early in the IPMMU code and
left unchanged.

I agree it would be better to not keep track of it.

Thanks for your suggestion. Sounds much cleaner.

We can fortunately mix and match what to enable between different
IPMMU instances, but this particular workaround is specific to some ES
version so once the errata is fixed it should be possible to fall back
to regular behaviour.

Will have a look! Let me know if you happen to attend FOSDEM, would be
good to discuss more if you have time!

Thanks for your help!
