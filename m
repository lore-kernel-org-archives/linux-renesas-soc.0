... which is correct.  It's saying

"If this is a Cortex-A9, FLZ was not enabled, and write_sec function is
not present, then enable FLZ.

Which is probably what everyone has.  This is not a feature that can be
enabled by the boot loader or firmware, it can only be done once the MMU
and caches are up and running.

... which we follow.

No.  There's no "want this feature".  The bit is almost certainly
guaranteed to be zero there - the bit isn't there to request the
feature.

And so results with it always being off everywhere.

I think a better question is:

 * Why does enabling FLZ break your system.

It can only be that your system doesn't wire the L2C-310 up to the Cortex
A9 correctly, missing the out-of-band signals that inform the L2C-310 that
the Cortex A9 wants it to zero a full cache line.

BTW, the bit in the auxilary control register merely _enables_ the
reception of that signal at the L2C-310.  If the signal is permanently
deasserted, the L2C-310 does nothing with it, and the bit is a no-op.

Where it does matter is at the Cortex-A9.  That changes the behaviour of
the Cortex-A9 from issuing multiple bus cycles zeroing the cache line
word by word, to merely signalling that it wants the L2C-310 to zero the
cache line.

So, if _merely_ enabling the FLZ bit in the 310's auxiliary control
register _without_ setting the bit in the Cortex-A9 as well leads to
memory corruption, it definitely means the 310 in your SoC is miswired,
and we need a DT property to reflect that.

Prefetching is entirely separate from FLZ.

That will definitely lead to data corruption.  The Cortex-A9 must _never_
have FLZ enabled on the CPU without (a) a compatible L2 cache controller
and (b) the feature _already_ enabled on the L2 cache controller and (c)
the cache controller is correctly wired to the Cortex-A9.

It sounds to me like you have a rare (the only?) system where (c) is
false.
