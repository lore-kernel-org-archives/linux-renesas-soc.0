No, sorry, but this is not the purpose of the flag. Actually there is
no reason at all to why genpd needs to skip invoking the driver's
noirq callbacks, no matter of whether the flag is set or not.

Moreover, skipping invoking callbacks would not work for those cases
where the driver needs to configure its wakeup setting in those
callbacks. Or if the driver has anything additional todo, like
disabling a request queue or whatever things, that it needs to manage
in those callbacks.

Instead this is about telling genpd that it must not power off the PM
domain (and in the special case of when genpd has the
->dev_ops.stop|start() assigned for the device, avoid to call them).

For that reason, I don't think the PM core needs to be involved,
besides what the patch already does.

Kind regards
