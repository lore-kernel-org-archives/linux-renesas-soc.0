I'm going to have a good read through the pinctrl documentation in the kern=
el
and have a look at the pinctrl-single driver and see if I can come up with
something that looks like option B.

Also, there are lots of drivers in the pinctrl directory, so I'll have a lo=
ok
at what other SoCs vendors are doing to see if there are any good ideas the=
re.

I can tell you that some of the other Renesas SoCs in pinctrl/sh-pfc like s=
h7757
and sh7724 are also per pin function type parts and might have worked bette=
r
with an option B type driver.
NOTE: I'm not saying we update those old crusty parts, but rather the R-Car
      PFC might be more non-standard.

Regards,
Chris
