Please have a look at the SBSA document, and in particular the
Appendix-F (registration and selling your soul required - only kidding):

http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.den0029/index.html

This requires that, in order for the two halves of GICV to be trappable
*separately* by a hypervisor using 64kB pages at Stage-2, the two 4kB
pages that describe that region are aliased as such:
- the first 4kB page is aliased 16 times over a 64kB region
- the second 4kB page is aliased 16 times over another contiguous 64kB
  region

This means that your GIC is indeed covering a 128kB region, with the
mapping corresponding to the GICv2 memory map located at offset 0xf000
from the base of that 128kB region. Also, this GICV requirement also
applies to GICC (most likely because the two regions use the same
decoding logic).

The OS must of course be aware of this (see gic_check_eoimode in the
GIC driver). Of course, almost nobody got that right (I only know of
the APM Xgene-1 so far). If you actually did, great!

Also, the ACPI spec fails to recognize this by not providing the length
of the region, meaning that those who got it right with DT are likely
to get it wrong with ACPI, and vice-versa.

It's a wonderful world.
