Hi Morimoto-san, Wolfram,

During the second system suspend (suspend to mem, "deep") on H3 Salvator-X,
the clk subsystem prints warnings due to enable and prepare count imbalances.

With some additional debug code, I discovered the issue is caused by the
CS2000 clock driver failing to resume:

suspend #1:

    rsnd_adg_clk_control: called by rsnd_suspend
    rsnd_adg_clk_control: Disable audio_clk_a
    rsnd_adg_clk_control: Disable clk_multiplier
    rsnd_adg_clk_control: Disable audio_clk_c
    rsnd_adg_clk_control: Disable s0d4

resume #1:

    dpm_run_callback(): cs2000_resume+0x0/0x20 returns -6
    PM: Device 2-004f failed to resume early: error -6

    rsnd_adg_clk_control: called by rsnd_resume

    rsnd_adg_clk_control: Enable audio_clk_c
    rsnd_adg_clk_control: Enable s0d4


suspend #2:

    rsnd_adg_clk_control: Disable audio_clk_a
    rsnd_adg_clk_control: Disable clk_multiplier

The CS2000 driver fails to send an i2c message, probably because the
rcar-i2c driver lost some register settings during system suspend.  This does
not happen with s2idle.

I guess this is also the reason for this warning:

    ak4613-codec 2-0010: Unable to sync registers 0x0-0x2. -6

as the ak4613 is connected to the same i2c bus.
