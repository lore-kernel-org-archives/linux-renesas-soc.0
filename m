Perhaps something to be discussed a kernel/mainainer-summit, cause at
the moment I don't think there is given policy.

OK.

I guess there are two other options to deal with this.

1) Don't merge my next branch, in case there is another branch based
on it. Instead, in this case, it will be Simon's responsibility of
re-basing his branch on top of mmc next, as to get the latest changes.
2) Base your WIP branches on top of some commit from Linus tree. Then
you can keep merging my next branch and any other "for-next" branch
that is often being re-based.

Yeah, thanks for the explanation - and apologize for the delay.

Kind regards
