I consider requesting exclusive access to a shared reset line a misuse
of the API. Are there such cases? Can they be fixed?

I'm not sure a new flag is necessary, this is what exclusive resets
should be.
Also I fear there will be confusion about the difference between
exclusive (refering to the reset control) and dedicated (refering to
the reset line) reset controls.

In case we have to add more flags, yes.

Which ones? And how?

I want to hear the device tree maintainers' opinion about this.
I'd very much like to have such a check for exclusive resets, but my
understanding is that we are not allowed to make the assumption that
other nodes' "reset" properties follow the common reset signal device
tree bindings.

Maybe this is something that should be checked in a device tree
validation step?
