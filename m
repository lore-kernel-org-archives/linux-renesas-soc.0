I think I'd go with CVBS as I don't think HDMI would be considered as the m=
ost=20
useful configuration here. The Draak board is unlikely to be used by us as =
a=20
reference platform to test HDMI capture, is it ?

This being said, you can instantiate the adv7612 and HDMI connector in DT,=
=20
without connecting them to the VIN. That would make it easy to quickly chan=
ge=20
the configuration.
