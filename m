You're not the only one, but at least you're not the one banging your
head against the desk while glaring into the scope and seeing nonsense
on one of the channels :-)

The physical VC5 5P49V5933 devkit has OUT0 , OUT1 and OUT4 . At first, I
thought it was laziness in the PCB design -- because there are VC5s with
up to 4 outputs and the devkit PCB is identical for all of them,
except some components are not populated -- but that is not correct.

They actually use (inside of the chip) output1 with fod1 and output4
with fod4 for the 5933 and they use output1 with fod1 and output2 with
fod2 on the 5923 . This became obvious after I took a look into the IDT
clock commander software, which has a visualization of the chip and
there are two "unpopulated" positions between out1 and out4 in case of
the 5933 while on 5923 the unpopulated positions are below out2 .

I have no explanation as for why they did this, it's just unsystematic.
