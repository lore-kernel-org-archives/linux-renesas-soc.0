So the first issue is definately gone.

Then it seems the driver is specifying to high ->max_seg_size
since the buffer cannot be mapped?

Unless you're using ADMA drivers/mmc/host/sdhci.c sets it as:
mmc->max_seg_size = mmc->max_req_size;

And:
mmc->max_req_size = 524288;

>> renesas_sdhi_internal_dmac ee100000.sd: swiotlb buffer is full (sz:
>> 524288 bytes)

So if your driver cannot handle 524288 bytes, why is it saying it can
handle 524288 bytes?

The MMC core will believe the claim is true, I guess maybe something
in the current tree (such as coalesced blocks or whatever) is finally
making this size of requests hit the driver (which is a good thing...)
just that it was never doing that before and now it turns out it can't
really handle that because of how the memory architecture or something
works.

I guess you need to figure out how big requests/segments this hardware
can really handle and pass that to mmc->mas_req_size, mmc->max_seg_size.

Sorry if my reasoning is dumb... need more coffee.
