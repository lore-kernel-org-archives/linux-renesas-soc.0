Subject: [PATCH 0/4] i2c: document DMA handling and add helpers for it
Date: Thu, 15 Jun 2017 20:30:35 +0200

So, after revisiting old mail threads and taking part in a similar discussion
on the USB list, here is what I cooked up to document and ease DMA handling for
I2C within Linux. Please have a look at the documentation introduced in patch 2
for further details.

The branch can be found here:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/wsa/linux.git renesas/topic/i2c-core-dma

And big kudos to Renesas Electronics for funding this work, thank you very much!

Regards,

   Wolfram

Changes since RFC:

* the helper i2c_check_msg_for_dma() can optionally take a pointer and then it
  will attach a bounce buffer to it in case the message buffer is not DMA safe
* a second helper was added. i2c_release_bounce_buf() will copy data back to
  the message buffer and release the bounce buffer
* the documentation has been extended to match the above
* no ifdeffery around CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG anymore. The I2C core behaviour
  should not depend on such symbols.
* the i2c-sh_mobile driver has been updated to use bounce buffers


Wolfram Sang (4):
  i2c: add helpers to ease DMA handling
  i2c: add docs to clarify DMA handling
  i2c: sh_mobile: use helper to decide if DMA is useful
  i2c: rcar: check for DMA-capable buffers
