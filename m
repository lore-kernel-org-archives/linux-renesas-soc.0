I expect to see more of these in the future.

Perhaps I just should forget about the product IDs and (marketing) families,
and just stick the CCCR/PRR addresses in the of_device_ids?
Then we'll have SoC names (e.g. "r8a7791") and (optional) revisions
(e.g. "ES1.0") to match on.

For R-Car H3, there are small differences between ES1.0 and ES1.1,
and more and larger differences between ES1.x and ES2.0, which
need different handling (patches already floating around).

For (old) R-Car H1, the SATA driver already handles "renesas,sata-r8a7790-es1",
but so far there didn't exist an established process to specify how that
compatible value would end up in the DTB (the in-kernel DTS doesn't have it).

There may be more differences I'm not aware of.

Yep, ca. 200 bytes per ID.

Sure.
