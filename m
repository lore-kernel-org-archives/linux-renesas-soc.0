Sort of.. The hardware does not have that, but we create them from pin 
configuration sub-nodes, as the pinmux core API is sort of 
group/function centric (see the pinmux_ops.set_mux function prototype)

This seems weird. The pinctrl generic functions indeed state that the 
caller
must take care of locking, but there doesn't seem to be any lock protecting
races between .dt_node_to_map() calling the generic functions below, and 
the
generic .get_group_*() handlers.

radix trees are RCU protected structures, so no locking should be 
required when accessing them from different places, so I guess lock here 
is just to protect the num_groups and num_functions variables in core 
pin controller driver...

That's an interesting one. If I have to free all data associated with 
that map (and I assume so) I shall be able to retrieve groups and 
functions that map represents and delete them and

Currently there is no generic pinctrl and pinmux function to retrieve a 
group or function by name, but only by their id (selector).
It would take 10minutes to add them, but I wonder if that's desirable or 
there are other ways to do so I haven't found out yet.

Linus, Tony and gpio people: do you have opinions on this? I can add 
those functions to core/pinmux in my next patch series if I get your ack 
here.

Thanks
