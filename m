thank you, I was unsure if you expected to get changes which can be used
as a base without patch application conflicts (my done choice) or changes,
which originally intorduced the bug, but formally require slightly
different fixes due to code changes in the middle. If it would be needed,
hopefully linux-stable maintainers can resolve the trivial conflicts.

Also you may find this information from the cover letter useful,
someone may want to check the relevant board schematics and send
similar fixes (if applicable after schematics review and testing):

  Note that DTS files for V3M Starter Kit, Draak and Eagle boards
  contain the same property, the files are untouched due to unavailable
  schematics to verify if the fix applies to these boards as well.
