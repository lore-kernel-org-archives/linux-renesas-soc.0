Subject: [PATCH v5 2/8] dt-bindings: display: renesas: Deprecate LVDS support in the DU bindings
Date: Thu, 22 Feb 2018 02:05:25 +0200

The internal LVDS encoders now have their own DT bindings, representing
them as part of the DU is deprecated.

Changes since v1:

- Remove the LVDS reg range from the example
- Remove the reg-names property
