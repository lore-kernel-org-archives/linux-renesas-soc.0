   Thank you.
   For the record, I had better luck than Geert testing SMP on Eagle: only CPU0
couldn't be offlined (and I was unable to find a workaround), others could be on/
offlined w/o issues. As for suspend/resume -- it did work but I could only test
s2idle (/sys/power/mem_sleep had no other variants)...
