Subject: [PATCH] mfd: dt: Add bindings for DA9063L
Date: Wed, 23 May 2018 13:26:44 +0200
Message-Id: <20180523112644.9464-1-marek.vasut+renesas@gmail.com>
Sender: linux-renesas-soc-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-renesas-soc.vger.kernel.org>

Add device tree bindings for the Dialog DA9063L. This is a
variant of the DA9063 chip with smaller package, with less
LDO regulators and without RTC block. The other properties
of the chip are the same, including the content of the chip
ID register.
