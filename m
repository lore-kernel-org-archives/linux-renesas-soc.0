Sorry for not being clearer.

What I would like to know is if there are any problems in the CAN driver
or hardware that would prevent it from functioning with memory that
requires 64bit addressing present.

If the CAN hardware cannot use DMA then DMA doesn't need to be taken into
account. But if it DMA could be enabled in future for CAN, for example
after some driver enhancements, then it would be good to know if 64bit
memory can be supported - if not it would imply DMA cannot be enabled.

As for non-DMA mode, will this function if memory above 4G is present?
If not then in theory such memory couldn't be enabled if the CAN driver
is enabled. This is my main concern.

Does the above help?
