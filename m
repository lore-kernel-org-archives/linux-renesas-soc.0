Currently we (usually) use:
  - SoC-specific compatible values, to handle known differences within the
    same family now, and handle future unknown differences,
  - Family-specific compatible values, which we define ourselves.

Usually drivers match on the latter.

Every time a new SoC is introduced, we have to update lots of DT binding
docs, to add the new SoC-specific compatible values.

Two-phase matching (driver code matches against "renesas,<foo>",
driver matches against SoC using soc_device_match()) would allow to
remove the burden of updating DT documentation all the time.
The drivers would need updates, though.
Another advantage would be that we can reuse .dtsi snippets for SoCs in
the same family, which we currently can't easily do due to the SoC-specific
compatible values.
