Subject: [PATCH 0/9] mmc: sh_mobile_sdhi: add HS200 support
Date: Mon, 12 Dec 2016 20:51:19 +0100

Here is a series adding HS200 support to the SDHI driver. Building the actual
functionality on top of SDR104 support was rather easy. However, I figured the
checks for enabling tuning were rather scattered over the driver and could be
further improved. So I did some refactoring of that to make adding HS200
support then a one-liner :)

This has been tested on Salvator-X boards with R-Car H3 and M3-W SoCs. It has
also been tested on a Lager board (R-Car H2) checking SDR50/104 for
regressions. The whole test document showing significant speed-ups reading from
the on-board eMMC can be found here:

and the branch can be found here:

Please comment, review, apply...

Thanks,

   Wolfram
