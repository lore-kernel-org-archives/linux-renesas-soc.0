arch_teardown_dma_ops does nothing if there is
no mapping (not behind iommu), dma_ops without iommu is ok.
But when the arm_iommu_create_mapping/arm_iommu_attach_device
was called previously in the iommu driver, after we teardown,
that path in the iommu driver which called those functions is not
replayed.
