I checked Porter specification and then I found 2 specifications exist...
 Porter "B" : mini AB connecter and Max3355 is on the board.
 Porter "C" : micro AB connect and Max3355 is not on the board. (Select host/peripheral by a jumper.)

I guess that your current target is "B".
If so, I think this patch is acceptable.
