The question I'm asking myself is: are these settings related to pin
configuration (i.e. depending on the use of the pin, and several settings
are valid, depending on the use case), or are they related to pinmux
(i.e. defined by the function)?

Configuring drive strength or pull-up are clearly related to pin
configuration.  Depending on what you connect, or on how you connect it,
you want a different drive strength, or choose a different output buffer
type (e.g. totem pole vs. open-collector). All of these are valid
configurations, depending on the use case.

But the settings RZ/A1H needs are different.  Some (e.g. "input-enable")
may sound like related to pin configuration. However, the big discerning
factor is that these settings are implied by the pinmux function. Their
presence is purely dictated by the chosen pinmux function. There's no use
case for doing otherwise (i.e. adding them when not needed, or removing
them when needed, according to the datasheet).

Note that e.g. the existing "input-enable" property is clearly a pin
configuration property. This is even reflected in DT, as the property is
not specified as part of the "pinmux" property, but in the surrounding pin
subnode of the pin-controller.

Hence I think we should not use generic pin properties, but consider these
settings to be part of pinmux configuration.
As having large tables in the driver is undesirable, I think storing the
settings in the "pinmux" property (by encoding them as flags passed to the
RZA1_PINMUX() macro) is our best option.
