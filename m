OK, that can be done.

More or less.

Unfortunately there exist SoCs from different families using the same
product ID.

And different SoCs from the same family may have a revision register
or not (e.g. R-Car H1 has, M1A hasn't).

For future SoCs, we  can easily make it mandatory.

Hmm... That means that if we have to add a driver quirk to distinguish
between different revisions of the same SoC, we have to update the
DTB anyway, to add the CCCR/PRR device node.
We might as well just change the compatible value in that DTB for the
device that needs the quirk. Which is what we'd like to avoid in the
first place.

OK.

It still saves ca. 3 KiB for a kernel for a single SoC.

It's been a while I've tried multi_v7_defconfig, but I'm afraid there's no
Renesas SoC left that can boot it, due to sheer size.
We're facing the same issue with arm64_defconfig soon (it already
fails now if you add a small (1.5 MiB) initrd).

Not to mention RZ/A1H, which is used on some boards running with
its 10 MiB of internal SRAM only.

Kernel size does matter, despite no progress on linux-tiny.
