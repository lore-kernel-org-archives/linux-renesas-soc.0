Hello,

This patch series enable DU support in DT for the R-Car H3 ES2.0 Salvator-X
board. Patch 1/2 extends the DT bindings as needed, and patch 2/2 then enables
DU in the SoC DT.

The patches are based on top of Simon's arm64-dt-for-v4.14 branch.

Compared to v1

- the VSP DT bindings have been extended in patch 1/2
- patch 2/2 has been updated accordingly
- patch "arm64: dts: r8a7795: salvator-x: Unify DU node between ES1.x and
  ES2.0" has been dropped
