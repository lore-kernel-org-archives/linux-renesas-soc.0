Perhaps I'm misunderstanding, but if you require a DTS patch to be
merged before a driver change then doesn't this mean that older DTBs
will stop working with newer kernels and the user is forced to update
the DTB to avoid breakage?

It would be nice if older DTBs could keep on working as before and the
DU driver modification would work both with connected VSPs and also
keep on working as before in case the VSP connection is not present in
DT.
