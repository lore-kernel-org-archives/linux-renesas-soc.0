Wrong.  You're confusing two different things.

The fixes tag identifies the commit to which the FIX applies.  That's
not what the kernelversion tag described above is for.  That's to
describe where the patch was GENERATED, so that it's easier to know
where it should be applied.

So what you're telling me is that you're unable to describe what commit
or the kernel version that the patch was GENERATED against.

I /really/ don't buy such an argument one bit.  If you don't have that
information, by definition you can't generate a git patch.

If it was trivial, then don't you think the patch would've been applied
without all this crap?  The proof is here in this thread, it's not as
trivial as you think it is.
