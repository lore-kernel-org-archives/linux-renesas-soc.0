Hi Niklas,

thanks for your work!

Use clamp_val()?

Is there no sysfs/debugfs way to get this from thermal core? I'd bet
this is of generic interest. Bonus point: if we drop this dbg, we can
also drop the 'dev' and 'num' members from the struct again.

Merge the two into one with a second parameter which is bool?
rcar_gen3_irq_enable(priv, true/false)?

Hmmm, with reusing 'i' for getting the interrupt resource, you assume
that the number of TSC will always equal the number of interrupts. It's
somewhat reasonable, yet we have seen enough surprises in HW to better
not assume it IMO.

Another advantage of decoupling it into a seperate loop is that you only
need to register as much interrupts as the driver actually uses. It uses
2 interrupts, so no need for installing 3 handlers, no?

I'd think the of_thermal_get_ntrips is a little bit hidden in the
dev_info. Would like it more explicitly. Also, it cannot fail? What
happens if DT provides broken trip points...

... because we enable interrupts unconditionally here?
