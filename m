Hmm, the two bindings cache-unified and cache-level are documented in 
bindings/arm/l2c2x0.txt, too.

I still can't see the benefit of adding entries to the device tree 
which are not used at all (and most probably don't make sense on that 
platform). But if anybody has a different opinion and maybe good 
arguments for it, that would be fine, too :)
