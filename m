I still don't quite understand this TBH.

In particular, why do you want a write to "wakeup" trigger this
instead of having a special sysfs attr for that exposed by your PMIC
driver?

Writing "enabled" to "wakeup" for the PMIC should enable the PMIC
itself to wake up the system, which isn't quite the case, or is it?

Thanks,
Rafael
