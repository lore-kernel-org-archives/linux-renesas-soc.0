I think I've been seeing the same as Niklas since quite a while.
Finally I had a deeper look, and it looks like there is a bug somewhere,
causing the wrong IOMMU PTE to be synced.

And so I did. After disabling the call to dma_debug_fs_init(), you can call
dma_debug_init() quite early. But the warning didn't go away:

    ipmmu-vmsa e67b0000.mmu: DMA-API: device driver tries to sync DMA memor=

    [<ffffff8008092d28>] __iommu_map_page+0x54/0x98

So, who allocated that memory?

During early kernel init (before fs_initcall(dma_debug_init)):

    arm-lpae io-pgtable: arm_lpae_alloc_pgtable:652: cfg->ias =3D 32
        data->pg_shift =3D 12 va_bits =3D 20
    arm-lpae io-pgtable: arm_lpae_alloc_pgtable:657: data->bits_per_level =
=3D 9
        data->levels =3D 3 pgd_bits =3D 2
    ipmmu-vmsa e67b0000.mmu: __arm_lpae_alloc_pages:224
        dma_map_single(0xffffffc63bab2000, 32) returned 0x000000067bab2000

Hence 0x67bab2000 is the PGD, which has only 4 entries (32 bytes).
Call stack:

    [<ffffff80082b9240>] __arm_lpae_alloc_pages.isra.11+0x144/0x1e8
    [<ffffff80082b93c0>] arm_64_lpae_alloc_pgtable_s1+0xdc/0x118
    [<ffffff80082b9440>] arm_32_lpae_alloc_pgtable_s1+0x44/0x68
    [<ffffff80082b8b1c>] alloc_io_pgtable_ops+0x4c/0x80
    [<ffffff80082bbf28>] ipmmu_attach_device+0xd0/0x3b0

When starting DMA from the device:

    iommu: map: iova 0xfffffff000 pa 0x000000067a555000 size 0x1000 pgsize =
4096

y
        it has not allocated [device address=3D0x000000067bab2ff8] [size=3D=
8 bytes]

__arm_lpae_map() added "ARM_LPAE_LVL_IDX(iova, lvl, data)" =3D=3D 0xff8 to =
ptep
(the PGD base address), but the PGD has only 32 bytes, leading to the warni=
ng.

Does my analysis make sense?
Do you have a clue?

Thanks!

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
