Ah, right you are, I missed that there was a separate check earlier.

Ideally, yes - the core code already has most of this covered, so taking
advantage of it would be good. I think the only slight hiccup is that
the 32-bit DMA code is then going to call attach_dev() with a domain you
probably don't want, before you get your add_device() call. Other than
handling that vs. group-based default domains for 64-bit, though, there
shouldn't be anything else to special-case, I don't think.

I'm finally starting to have a look into converting the arch/arm code
over to use groups and default domains sensibly, but I suspect that's
ultimately going to have some dependency on the probe deferral stuff,
rather than introduce the same bus notifier bodge we currently have on
arm64.

Robin.
