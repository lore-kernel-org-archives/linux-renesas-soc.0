I have applied the above patchset for v4.14.

And this one too.

And this one seems to have been acked, so I assume you will
apply it once you are back from holidays.

So I have applied the first two patches for v4.14.
Please repost the remaining two after v4.13-rc6 at which time I should
be able to queue them up for v4.15.
