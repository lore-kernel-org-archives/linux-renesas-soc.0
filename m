You'd be moving the issue to userspace.  This would be beneficial if you
were looking to use the buffered interfaces (through a kfifo).  In those
cases processed values are often a non starter as they don't have well
defined 'sizes' in the same way that a reading directly from the chip does.

So under those circumstances, your userspace code might elect to modify
the gain to get in the 'right' region only at startup, or after some initial
'calibration data capture'.  Then it could merily stream data out without
caring about it.  To run remotely fast and consistenty you'd have to stop
doing the multiple passes needed for autogain.

However, if that interface never makes sense for this device anyway then
it the approach of doing it all in kernel makes more sense.

With a 500sps device like this it's on the boundary to my mind...

Quick enough that using the chardev access makes sense, but the usecase
is perhaps such that we should leave this all in kernel space.

It's slightly horrible but there is a path forward eventually if we
were to add buffered support having gone with the do it all in the kernel:
* Add a 'autorange_enable' attribute to allow us to turn it off or implicitly
assume that it is turned off if we are doing buffered capture (which is a bit
nasty from a 'doing what you'd expect' viewpoint).
* Add scale attributes at that stage.

Now, if the auto range stuff was done on the actual chip we could figure
out how to export that as pseudo channels alongside the real ones but
that might get uggly and isn't the case here anyway.
