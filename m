Well, if it's an API violation then I'll remove it. But removing the 
propagation will put (more) burden on userland.  In imx the sub-device 
does the cropping and scaling, but the video_device connected  to it 
does not. Which means the compose rectangle in the video_device must 
always be the same as the sub-device compose rectangle.

Does sending the V4L2_EVENT_SOURCE_CHANGE event to automatically reset 
the video_device format when the sub-device format changes also violate 
the API? I don't see why it would, it's just making use of the event 
mechanism. If you agree then I will do the same in imx, and offer it as 
a patch to rcar-vin (to ensure the rcar video_device's crop bounds are 
always correct).

If you don't agree then perhaps imx and rcar-vin can at least do the 
equivalent of v4l2-core, which is to ensure the video_device formats are 
compatible with the connected sub-device before streaming can start.
