Completely agreed.

And yes the current assumption is that the set of wake-up source in DT
applies to the suspend-to-idle case and may/may not from the deeper
s2ram state.

Sorry if I conveyed something else in my emails. I was mostly referring
to the patch set and the way it's hacking up. I still fail to understand
what Geert is doing different in his "shallow" state that "s2idle" can't
achieve that state. So my comments were more aligned to that when I made
the above comment.
