Just to point out that this proposed change won't affect the existing 
R-Car devices, but would apply to RZ/A-like devices currently not 
supported and which may appear in future (and according to Chris, to 
some old SH ones which no one wants to touch ;P )

I'm thinking about something like

drivers/pinctrl/sh-pfc/ (which would be better re-named as rcar-pfc)
drivers/pinctrl/rz-pfc/

But that's a big change that may upset some people here :)

A big difference from what pinctrl-single does and what the table-based 
approach does is that it creates groups, pins and functions at run-time, 
parsing the dts...
There's indeed quite some code there for doing this, but it does not 
perform any validation of what the dts describes.
Maybe we can skip all that part (parsing and run-time generation of 
groups, pins and function) using tables, and adopt a pin-oriented ABI 
that would allow us to specify in the dts the function and the per-pin 
configuration that would look more natural for this kind of devices.

As a final note: maybe we need to decide what to do with this series, 
people is spending time reviewing it, and I've just sent v2 out. If we 
want to go in a different direction, we should stop here :)

Thanks
