Both the existing RZ/A model and the pinctrl model are in my opinion 
improvements over the RZ/G and R-Car models. I don't care much about whether 
pinctrl-single can be used, but we really need hardware architectures that 
don't require those huge data tables.

I'll cross my fingers.

No, you can't appreciate it, no matter what :-)

It's more complex than that. Both the pin-based and group-based models have 
their pros and cons, and the pinctrl API is some kind of mix that allows both 
options.
