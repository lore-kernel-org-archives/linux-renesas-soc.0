Well... from a hardware point of view, the LVDS encoders and DU channels
are all separate blocks (they have separate reg blocks, clocks, and resets).
But due to the dependencies between the blocks, they're modeled in DT as
a single device, with multiple reg, clocks, and resets properties.

The resets follow the clocks closely, as they're handled by the same block
(CPG/MSSR = Module Standby and Software Reset), except for a few quirks
(e.g. one reset for all DU channels on R-Car Gen2, one reset per pair of
 channels on R-Car Gen3).

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
