Hi,

this patch-set adds Z and Z2 clock support.

These are dependencies for supporting CPUFreq. The remainder of that
work is being posted separately and can be found at:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/horms/renesas.git topic/r8a7796-cpufreq


A description of steps taken to lightly exercise the same feature for the
r88a7795 the above can be found at the link below. The results are the same
for the r8a7796 with the exception that it has two active CPU cores rather
than four.

This series is based on and depends on
"[PATCH 0/4] r8a7795: Add Z and Z2 clock support"
