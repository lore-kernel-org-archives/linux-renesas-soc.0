I also think it's a benefit if the group names are identical on H3 and 
M3-W. And I think it is unfortunate that the name do not match Gen2 
naming.

When adding the pins to r8a7795 I thought of instead adding AVB_MDIO to 
the group avb_mdc add a new group with the Gen2 naming (avb_mdio) and 
add both AVB_MDC and AVB_MDIO to this group but still also keep the 
group avb_mdc. If I had done that it would be compatible with Gen2 
naming and backward compatible with old H3 DT. Maybe I was wrong of not 
doing it like this and perhaps that solution should be revisited? That 
is keep avb_mdc as is on H3 for backward compatibility but add avb_mdio to 
both H3 and M3-W and update H3 DT to use avb_mdio.

In any case I reviewed the pins as it is identical to how it's done on 
H3. So if you choose to move forward with this approach feel free to 
add:
