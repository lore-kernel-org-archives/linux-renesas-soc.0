Hello Simon,

Thank you for the feedback.

Exactly. The extra registers found with the RZ/G1C I2C controller are also =
found in R-Car Gen3,
but the driver doesn't handle them. R-Car Gen3 has more registers on top of=
 those found
with the RZ/G1C.

Since the driver is not using ICCCR2, ICMPR, ICHPR, and ICLPR, what's left =
is compatible
with R-Car Gen2.
I have tested I2C4 on its own and with the HDMI transmitter found on the iw=
g23s, and
so far so good.

Exactly. If anybody ever looks into supporting the missing functionality th=
e SoC
specific string could be used to pick up better driver support (although Ge=
n2
support would probably still be alright).

I hope this clarifies things a little bit better.

Thanks,
Fab
