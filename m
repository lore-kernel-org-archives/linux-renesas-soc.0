Right, that seems to be the way things have happened.

Some sort of agreed format sounds good.

Your proposal of <vendor>,<chip>-<device> sounds good to me.

I'm however slightly more confused by seeing that your example
renesas,rcar-dmac.txt included in renesas-drivers-2016-02-16-v4.5-rc4
does not match the proposed format:

$ grep "renesas," Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/renesas,rcar-dmac.txt
- compatible: "renesas,dmac-<soctype>", "renesas,rcar-dmac" as fallback.
        - "renesas,dmac-r8a7790" (R-Car H2)
        - "renesas,dmac-r8a7791" (R-Car M2-W)
        - "renesas,dmac-r8a7792" (R-Car V2H)
        - "renesas,dmac-r8a7793" (R-Car M2-N)
        - "renesas,dmac-r8a7794" (R-Car E2)
        - "renesas,dmac-r8a7795" (R-Car H3)
        compatible = "renesas,dmac-r8a7790", "renesas,rcar-dmac";
        compatible = "renesas,dmac-r8a7790", "renesas,rcar-dmac";

Right, but for rcar-dmac.c there is no matching on per-SoC strings in
the driver so I guess we can pick anything we want?

$ grep "renesas," drivers/dma/sh/rcar-dmac.c
    { .compatible = "renesas,rcar-dmac", },
$

No need to rework existing stuff IMO. However once we rework DT
bindings (CMT) or add new ones (SYS-DMAC) then we have a good
opportunity to clean things up.
