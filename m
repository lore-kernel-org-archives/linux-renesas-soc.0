Not presently. I'm somewhat surprised that this patch would have that
effect -- I would imagine that the rework this is based on is more
likely to. e.g. commit:

  c09adab01e4aeecf ("drivers/perf: arm_pmu: split irq request from enable")

Just to check, you definitely don't see these warnings immediately prior
to applying this patch?

My best guess otherwise is that prior to this patch, the PMU IRQ
request was failing earlier, and we bailed out.

Can you dump a dmesg before and after this patch, and see if the arm_pmu
driver dumps anything?

Thanks,
Mark.
