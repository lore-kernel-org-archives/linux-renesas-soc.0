The driver calls pm_runtime_set_active() during ->probe(), which means
genpd's ->runtime_resume() callback isn't invoked during that point.
In other words, the clocks managed by the clock domain isn't enabled
during ->probe() as genpd's doesn't get to run pm_clk_resume() from
its ->runtime_resume() callback. Unless I am missing something. :-)

I think this is the reason to the following problems. How to fix it?

The driver needs to call pm_runtime_get_sync() instead of
pm_runtime_set_active(), however that may requires some careful
changes if one wants the driver to be able to enable clocks also when
CONFIG_PM is unset. If not, it's pretty easy, else I would do
something like below.

Add a "init" flag to host struct, and set that flag before calling
pm_runtime_get_sync() in ->probe(). When the driver's
->runtime_resume() callbacks get called when the "init" flag is set,
just do an early return 0, as t means ->probe() is running and has
already taken care of the enabling the clock. When probe is done, and
before dropping runtime usage count with pm_runtime_put(), reset the
"init" flag.
