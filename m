Subject: [PATCH v2 00/11] mmc: document mmc_regulator_get_supply and fix users
Date: Sat, 14 Oct 2017 21:17:08 +0200

Fix the drivers and add some docs according to the outcome of this discussion
[1] we had recently. The motivation from the patch description:

Bail out everytime when mmc_regulator_get_supply() returns an errno, not only
when probing gets deferred. This is currently a no-op, because this function
only returns -EPROBE_DEFER or 0 right now. But if it will throw another error
somewhen, it will be for a reason. (This still doesn't change that getting
regulators is optional, so 0 can still mean no regulators found). So, let us a)
be future proof and b) have driver code which is easier to understand.

The patches have been created with coccinelle. A branch can be found here:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/wsa/linux.git renesas/mmc-get-supply-docs

Looking forward to comments!

Kind regards,

   Wolfram
