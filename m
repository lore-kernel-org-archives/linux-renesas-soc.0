Ok, so something like this?

	if (host->check_scc_error)
		cmd->error = host->check_scc_error(host);

Previously tmio_mmc_hw_reset() was called which implicitly requested
retuning.

I think I should go back to calling tmio_mmc_hw_reset() here
assuming that the core will cause retuning to occur if an error
is returned (not so far below).

I'll see about removing the else clause.

Yes, I expect so.

For example by setting a field in the private host structure such
that tmio_mmc_finish_request can set cmd->error = -EILSEQ ?
