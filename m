I am guessing the issue is triggered by genpd in the suspend noirq
phase (genpd_suspend_noirq()). In there,  there is a call to
pm_runtime_force_suspend() (which calls pm_runtime_set_suspended() and
which triggered the earlier error messages being printed).

The reason why genpd calls pm_runtime_force_suspend(), is because when
validating wakeup configurations for the device "if
(dev->power.wakeup_path && genpd_is_active_wakeup(genpd))", it's
thinks wakeup isn't configured while it probably should be.

An additional note, only when genpd has the GENPD_FLAG_PM_CLK set,
which makes the genpd->dev_ops.stop|start() being assigned, genpd
calls pm_runtime_force_suspend() - else it doesn't.

Perhaps try out the series I recently posted improving the code
dealing with wakeups in genpd and the PM core:
https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-renesas-soc/msg20122.html
To that, you need to set the new flag (invented in the above series)
DPM_FLAG_IN_BAND_WAKEUP in the driver that configures wakeup of its
device.

Hope this helps!

Please keep me posted, I am interested about the why the problem exists. :-)
