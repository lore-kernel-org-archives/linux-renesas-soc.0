To be honest I'd also get rid of DAIs has a top level concept. This image
(http://metafoo.de/the_new_asoc.svg) is something I've put together awhile
ago how I think we should lay things out if we do a major refactoring of the
ASoC core.

The big green and blue boxes are components. Green are On-SoC components,
blue are external components.

The light grey boxes are domains. Domains have certain properties, like e.g.
samplerates. There are different types of domains and different types have
different kinds of properties. E.g. in the PCM domain we care about the
memory layout of the samples in addition to the samplerate and the number of
channels, while in the digital domain however we do no longer care about the
memory layout since here data is processed one sample at a time. In the I2S
link domain we care about which I2S mode is used (I2S, LJ, ...), while in a
SPDIF link domain we don't care about such properties.

The dark grey boxes are bridges between domains and they translate
properties from one domain to another. This can either be straight forward
propagation like a PCM device where the samplerate in the source and target
domain are the same, or it can modify the properties, e.g. a samplerate
converter between two digital domains will change the samplerate according
to the interpolation/decimation factor of the SRC.

In addition to just translating the properties a bridge can also translate
the constraints on properties from one domain to another or even add its own
constraints. E.g. if a CODEC has a constraint that it can run either with
48kHz or 96kHz this constraint is propagated through the bridges to the PCM
devices so that the userspace application using the PCM is aware of this.
Bridges can also add their own constraints e.g. a SRC might have multiple
interpolation/decimation rates available, so it might say the samplerate in
the target domain must be 1x or 2x that of the source domain. Going back to
the example that means for a CODEC that supports either 48kHz or 96kHz and
there is a SRC with interpolation factors of 1 or 2 then the PCM device will
present the list of either 24kHz, 48kHz or 96kHz to the userspace application.

A bridge is also not limited to one source and one sink. It can have
multiple sources and multiple sinks e.g. for a crossbar with a complex
routing matrix.

Obviously we can't convert everything at the same time and it will take a
lot of time and effort to update all drivers to this new model. This is
where the legacy bridge kicks in which still keeps the concept of 1 CPU, 1
CODEC, 1 platform. If you want to use the advanced features of the new
framework you have to update your driver, if you are OK with the current set
of features just keep the drivers the way they are and use the legacy bridge
that is automatically managed by the ASoC core.
