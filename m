I only see PERW_MAIN, not PERW_BUS. There's a PERW_MAIN_MP sub-hierarchy
though. And I'm fairly sure there are errors in the diagrams (at least
in the VIO hierarchy).

I haven't found any sign neither in the documentation nor in the SCP
firmware sources that those would be gateable. If they are, they are not
gated by default.

In any case, I think it would make sense to model in DT all the clocks
listed in the diagrams. That should make it possible to properly handle
gates after the fact, should there be any.

Yes, I forgot to mention that.

I expect the FCK input of the IP core to be connected to the clock gated
by the MDLC. Using SGASYNCD4_PERW_BUS in DT is likely inaccurate. It
should work fine for now as the SCP firmware doesn't make the clock
controllable, but I'm not sure that the bus clock is really always on.
The dividers listed in the CPGMA* diagrams typically have clock gating
capability.

It's worse than that. The firmware doesn't implement parent-child
relationships, but sometimes it tries to control the parent
independently from different children :-(

Look for instance at the DPCKCR register. bit CKSTP is documented as
gating the DP_EXT_VIO_DP[012] clocks. I expect that bit to actually gate
the parent clock, DP_EXT_VIO (from CPGMA1). However, the three separate
DP_EXT_VIO_DP[012] clocks exposed by the SCMI firmware (and named
SCP_CLOCK_ID_CLK_DP_EXT_OTHER[012] because consistent names wouldn't be
confusing enough) all map to the DPCKCR.CKSTP bit in the backend, and
are reference-counted separately.

It's tempting. Maybe doing it per-hierarchy ? When enabling devices in
the VIO hierachy, I ended up verifying most of the clocks anyway. We can
then try to spot all inconsistencies and ask for confirmation.
