No, it is not.

Enabling generation of wakeup signals at a device doesn't guarantee
that the interrupt (or GPIO etc) controller will be functional when
those signals reach it, for example.

There actually is no way to guarantee that in general.  In the ACPI
land, for example, devices may be able to wake up the system from S3,
but not from S4 or S5, and you can't say "I want that device to wake
up the system from S4", because that may be physically impossible to
achieve.

In theory, that should be some code that knows how the platform is
configured and can set up things to work as expected.

That's why we have all of the platform hooks, syscore operations etc
(of course, all of that is not needed for suspend to idle, because it
is entered via the idle path and wakeup signals for wakeup devices
should be handled then).

Thanks,
