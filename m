Indeed, 40-bits.

Right, I completely forgot that I was still running with a patch to
allow the DMAC to use 40-bit addresses:

    dma_set_mask_and_coherent(dmac->dev, DMA_BIT_MASK(40));

which works fine without IOMMU, but fails with, as the IPMMU-VMSA driver
doesn't support that yet.

Thanks a lot, and sorry for the noise...
