Yes, this is clearly a common use case. Although, I am sure we have more.

For example, phys may need a very similar treatment, in case their
consumers requires its phy to be running - as to be able to receive
signals for wakeups. Anyway, let's discuss other cases separately and
focus on yours with the irqchip for now.

Okay, thanks for confirming this.

This also clarifies why you set the ->power.wakeup_path flag for the
renesas irqchip device in your other series [1]. That makes perfect
sense to me, in this regards.

Agree.

Putting together the pieces of information received here, you have
convinced me that we should stick to use the current
GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP for now, which allows genpds to opt-in for
start dealing with in-band-wakeups.

Then, as you suggest, we need a method for the driver to set an
opt-out flag for its device, in case it configures an out-band-wakeup.
In other words, we should have an OUT_BAND_WAKEUP flag instead of an
IN_BAND_WAKEUP flag.

That together with an option of allowing "consumed resource-devices"
(irqchip) to be included in the wakeup path. I am thinking, perhaps
another driver PM flag (DPM_FLAG_WAKEUP_PATH), that the PM core looks
at and sets ->power.wakeup_path flag for the device and its parents.

Let me re-spin this series. Perhaps I fold in some of the changes from
your series as well, as to provide people with a complete picture.

Any further comments? Does it makes sense?

Kind regards
Uffe
