Yes it is well known fact. But where this is a feature or limitation
is debatable. Why would SCP firmware churn and re-number or re-assign
a differ domain ID everytime it is updated is questionable to me.

No sure if I understand the issue here.

Again, features must be discoverable that is the advantage of DT vs this
firmware interface, so not sure what is the issue in this matter.

True, the moment SCMI like interface is used in OSPM, the firmware
description hides real h/w details and provide what firmware thinks
OSPM must view hardware as(how VMMs virtualise things for VMs, firmware
can have similar effect with such interfaces).

OK, that's interesting. But the whole point with these interfaces is to
hide those, so just don't use such abstraction interface if you want the
hardware to be described as is to the OSPM.

Not sure what that means, you mean clock protocol is not good enough to
model the h/w clock domains on your platform ? If so, you are welcome to
improve the specification.

I am going to ignore that.

Fair enough, but the acceptance of such changes depends on maintenance
and possible absuse with such spec deviations.
