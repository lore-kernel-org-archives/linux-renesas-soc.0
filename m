Well, it should have been done this way from the beginning, but
pwm_apply_args() was introduced before the commit introducing the atomic
APIs, and I forgot to update it when moving to the atomic approach :-/.

Indeed. I can add it back here if you prefer, but honestly, PWM users
that are not checking the value returned by pwm_get() should be
considered buggy IMHO, and a NULL pointer exception is a good way to
make people realize they are not properly using the API :).
