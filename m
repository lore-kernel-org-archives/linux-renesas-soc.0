Well I don't have the series in my inbox, but browsing through
the patchwork seems OK. The things to check would be:

1. Do you guys really need RZ_PIN_DESC? Just let pinctrl
   framework generate the names, then do some simple user
   space tool that decodes the debugfs output. If you really
   need names, allow the consumer to set the name like we do
   for GPIOs and interrupts when requesting the resource.

2. Make sure you're using hardware offsets for any indexing
   to avoid adding artificial mapping tables between the driver
   and the the dts file. Many times new features are enabled
   between SoC revisions and a numbered index gets out of sync
   and needs constant patching just like we have for interrupt
   numbers earlier.. I don't think that's an issue with this
   series, but please check one more time for easy maintenance :)

Regards,

Tony
