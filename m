I don't have the schematics so i was simply keeping the current state.
I've added Phil Edworthy to the list as he was the one originally
enable the bus clk for Koelsh according to git. Hopefully he can
clarify :)

You were the one enabling this clock for Porter ;) I don't have PCIE
hardware to test with on my porter board, might be worth if you could
disable this clock and see if PCI-E still fucntions as expected (maybe
in practise it just happens to prefer the internal clock?) ?

I did that as it was by default disabled, so if i do enable it but
don't drop the default frequency to 0 board swithout that clock will
suddenly have it added to their dtb.

For the usb external clock I didn't touch it as it was already enabled
by default with a proper frequency, so it wouldn't hit the issue i was
trying to fix here. But i agree, both looking at other Renesas dtsis
and how all other external clocks are done in this dtsi, this node is
odd.
