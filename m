Sorry for chime in this topic but I think for some cases, for instance,
mmc_host_set_uhs_voltage calls mmc_delay and it should guarantee the
delay is accurate, especially for the comment"Keep clock gated for at
least 10 ms, though spec only says 5 ms"

But the usleep_range won't guarantee that, see

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9369963/

It wasn't fixed at the end, so you should carefully modify
this fundamentally.
