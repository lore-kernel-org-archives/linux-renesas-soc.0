Not that there is an inherent danger in taking of_args.args[2] without
validation to support future SoCs without driver changes.
port_names[] is a fixed size array, so an SoC with more pins will
cause memory access beyond the end of the array. Possibly there are
other locations that need to be changed.

So IMHO it's better to have explicit support for different SoCs using
different compatible values, so you can store the number of pins in
of_device_id.data, and validate against that.

See, if npins becomes larger, you'll overflow port_names[].
