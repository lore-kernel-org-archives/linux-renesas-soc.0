Subject: [PATCH v6 0/9] UHS-I SDR-104 support for sh_mobile_sdhi

Hi,

this series is based on work by Ai Kyuse to add UHS-I SDR-104 support for
sh_mobile_sdhi. It builds on work by Shinobu Uehara, Rob Taylor, William
Towle and Ian Molton, Ben Hutchings, Wolfram Sang and others to add UHS-I
SDR-50 support to the same driver.

This series enables:
* UHS-I SDR-104 on the r8a7790/Lager where UHS-I SDR-50 is already enabled.
* Both UHS-1 SDR-50 and SDR-104 on the r8a7796/Salvator-X

It is based on a merge of the next branches of the mmc and renesas trees.

The "mmc:" patches are targeted at the next branch of the mmc
tree. The "ARM:" and "arm64:" patches are targeted at the next branch of
the renesas tree.

To aid review the following git branches are provided:
* https:://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/horms/renesas.git topic/sdr104-v6
  This patch set
* https:://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/horms/renesas.git topic/sdr104-v6+sdhi-dma-v3
  This patch set merged with a rebase of prototype DMA support for SDHI on
  R-Car Gen 3

Overview of changes since v5:
* Drop retune handling from tmio suspend handler: it hs handled by MMC core
* Allow restoration of saved tuning parameters on resume

Please see http://elinux.org/Tests:SD-SDHI-SDR104 for indicative tests
results.
