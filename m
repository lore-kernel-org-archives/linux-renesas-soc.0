Subject: [PATCH 2/3] PM / core: Add WAKEUP_POWERED driver flag
Date: Wed,  8 Nov 2017 16:15:33 +0100

For some bus types and PM domains, it's not sufficient to only check the
return value from device_may_wakeup(), to fully understand how to treat the
device during system suspend.

In particular, sometimes the device may need to stay in full power state,
to have wakeup signals enabled for it. Therefore, define and document a
WAKEUP_POWERED flag, to enable drivers to instruct bus types and PM domains
exactly about that.

During __device_suspend() in the PM core, let's make sure to also propagate
the setting of the flag to the parent device, when wakeup signals are
enabled and unless the parent has the "ignore_children" flag set. This
makes it also consistent with how the existing "wakeup_path" flag is being
assigned.

 and :c:func:`pci_enable_wake()` does something similar for the PCI PME signal.
 
+Moreover, in case wakeup signals are enabled for a device, some bus types and
+PM domains may manage the device slightly differently during system suspend. For
+example, sometimes the device needs to stay in full power state, to have wakeup
+signals enabled for it. In cases when the wakeup settings are mostly managed by
+the driver, it may not be sufficient for bus types and PM domains to only check
+the return value of :c:func:`device_may_wakeup(dev)`, to understand what actions
+are needed. Therefore, drivers can set ``DPM_FLAG_WAKEUP_POWERED`` in
+:c:member:`power.driver_flags`, by passing the flag to
+:c:func:`dev_pm_set_driver_flags` helper. This instructs bus types and PM
+domains to leave the device in full power state, when wakeup signals are enabled
+for it.
+
 If any of these callbacks returns an error, the system won't enter the desired
 low-power state.  Instead, the PM core will unwind its actions by resuming all
 the devices that were suspended.
