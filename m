Do we? The divisor is not part of PLL0. The datasheet says:

  - For V2H/E2:
    "PLL circuit 0 multiplies EXTAL or EXTAL/2 clock."
  - For the other SoCs:
    "PLL circuit 0 multiplies EXTAL or EXTAL/2 clock. The
multiplication ratio is set by the PLL0CR."

Division is done _after_ PLL0, using the SYS-CPU clock divider.

 - For e.g. E2:
   "The SYS-CPU clock divider 1 divides PLL0 output clock. This
divider generates the AP-System core clocks (Z2=CF=86)."

AFAIU, this SYS-CPU clock divider is "/3" on E2.
