I also couldn't come up with something working when I looked at this,
and it wouldn't solve the related problem of platforms that we want to
be able to use with or without MMU: You can't make the decision of
whether allow an MMU based on the number of platforms since most
platform options can only be offered depending on the setting of
CONFIG_MMU.

And I really don't like adding new top-level for a platform here, it
brings us back to the same problems we had before we moved most platforms
to ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM, and it doesn't solve the remaining problems we still
have:

- In some platforms, the decision would have to be done on a per-board
  level, as each board can have its memory at a different location
  base on which chipselect line got connected to the RAM and NOR flash
  respectively

- Some (few) platforms actually have separate top-level Kconfig options
  but are actually very closely related and you could have a kernel
  for all of them even with !MMU and XIP_KERNEL. The most important
  one here is ARM Versatile/Realview/Integrator/Vexpress that have
  more in common than things we put behind a common Kconfig option in
  other platforms.

- CONFIG_DEBUG_UNCOMPRESS has a very similar requirements to
  XIP_KERNEL and !MMU, and we currently allow it for any machine,
  with a lot of flexibility in configuring that always breaks
  running on any machine other than the one you are targetting.
