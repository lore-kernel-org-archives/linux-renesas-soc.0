I think we should just forget about the JTAG pins completely.
Honestly, they are 2 pins that can only be configured as JTAG or a GPIO inp=
ut
(not even output).
No one is using those pins for anything other than JTAG.

IMHO, adding extra support just for those 2 pins is basically a waste of co=
de.
