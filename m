Yes it is, and I actually like your proposal, I was just trying to
make sure I was not confusing the property semantic with its
real-world effect.

If no one as different opinions on this, I can send a patch later to
add output-enable only, or since you have almost done it down here you
can do the same resusing what you have proposed below.

I would not mention the "input buffer" here, as enabling input implies enabling
the buffer if you want to read values from there. Actually I guess
there may be platforms where buffer enabling may be implicit, so I
would leave this out and let drivers handle it internally.
