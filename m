Thanks for your patch!

Isn't the idea to fall back to PIO if the DMA-engine driver is not found?

Unfortunately there's no way to distinguish between "DMA-engine hasn't been
probed yet" and "DMA-engine is not available" (e.g. CONFIG_RCAR_DMAC=n).
In both cases, dma_request_chan() will return -EPROBE_DEFER.
So if you treat this as an actual error, and propagate it, the following
will happen:
  - In case 1, the MMC driver will be reprobed successfully later.
  - In case 2,the MMC driver will never succeed.

Or am I missing something?
