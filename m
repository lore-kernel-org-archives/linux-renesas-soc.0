It seems you are missing the point from electrical prospective.
Standard pin buffers (electrically) means input buffer and output
buffer that are driven independently in most cases.

Here is one example:
https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/96932/internal-circuitry-of=
-io-ports-in-mcu/96953#96953

(That's what I asked before as a schematic)

No.

You are trying to introduce an abstraction, called BiDi, which is
*not* a separate thing from a set of pin properties.

Yes.
BiDi is an alias to output + input enable + other pin configuration
parameters (a set depends on real HW needs).

Perhaps needs to be revisited as well.

P.S. It looks like more and more software engineers are going far from
real hardware when developing drivers...
