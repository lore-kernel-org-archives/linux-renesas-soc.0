I think the question is different. The question is, if a difference comes
up, how do we handle it?

So far we have a solution. Not an ideal one, but a solution none the less.
I do agree entirely that replicated DTs leads to significant maintenance
overhead. But lets not throw the baby out with the bath water.

Point taken. Lets discuss the change on its merits.

I think that most of the nodes you have moved into the common dtsi file
make sense. But there are some I am less sure about:

* cpus

  Probably there are some central aspects of cpus that are shared
  between the r8a7795 and r8a7796. And I think that your patch captures
  that. But I also think that there will be non-shared aspects and
  perhaps the complexity of splitting the cpus node between per-SoC
  and common dtsi files isn't worth it.

  I don't feel strongly about this at this point.

  I am also particularly sensitive about enabling CPU features across
  multiple SoCs. But I think that the scheme you propose allows for
  per-SoC control of features in per-SoC dtsi files. So I think
  I am ok about that at this point.

  Lastly, shouldn't the cache-controller go inside the cpu node
  in the common dtsi file to reflect the change recently made
  upstream to r8a7795.dtsi and the structure of r8a7796.dtsi in
  the current patchset (v3).

* cpg, scif2

  This is the compatibility string issue.

  Could we at least agree to defer this part of the discussion
  and thus omit these nodes from the common dtsi file at this time?

  I understand that you are concerned that if we don't handle this
  now it will be forgotten. FWIW I strongly doubt this particular
  problem will be forgotten.
