I'd like to get a picture of any one-cell GPIO DTS:es and/or drivers
still around.

I would like to deal with them somehow.

When we started the big DT migration this was one of the areas
we made some screwups in, admittedly, but someone just has to
go first, and that was incidentally GPIO controllers.

At this time people were even playing around with DT bindings in
BNF form, which is why the GPIO binding is a bit .. esoteric
at times. I guess I should fix that.
