  ARM: dts: r8a7740: Add CEU1 (2018-05-16 10:54:50 +0200)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Renesas ARM Based SoC DT Updates for v4.18

* R-Mobile A1 (r8a7740) SoC
  - Describe CEU, IRQC, SYS-DMAC and USB devices

  - Cleanup for consistency with other Renesas SoCs and enhanced maintainability
    + Stop grouping clocks under a "clocks" subnode
    + Add soc node
    + Sort subnodes of root and soc nodes

* RZ/A1H (r7s72100) SoC
  - Describe CEU device

* R-Car Gen2, RZ/G1 and RZ/A1H SoCs
  - Add PMU device nodes

    Geert Uytterhoeven says: "This patch series enables support for the ARM
    Performance Monitor Units in Cortex-A7, Cortex-A9, and Cortex-A15 CPU
    cores on Renesas RZ/A1, R-Car Gen2, and RZ/G1 SoCs.  This allows for
    better performance analysis using the "perf" tool."

* RZ/A1H (r7s72100) SoC
  - Correct interrupt types

    Geert Uytterhoeven says "RZ/A1H peripherals use a mix of level and edge
    interrupts.

    This patch series corrects the interrupt types for watchdog and RTC from
    edge to level, to match the datasheet."

* R-Mobile APE6 (r8a73a4) APE4EVM board and SH-Mobile AG5 (sh73a0) SoC
  - Use generic disable-wp instead of now deprecated
    toshiba,mmc-wrprotect-disable property

* EMMA Mobile EV2 (emev2) and SH-Mobile AG5 (sh73a0) SoCs
  - Add missing interrupt-affinity to PMU

    Geert Uytterhoeven says "The Cortex-A9 PMU nodes on SH-Mobile AG5 and
    Emma Mobile EV2 reference two interrupts, but lack interrupt-affinity
    properties, leading to:

    hw perfevents: no interrupt-affinity property for /pmu, guessing.

    This series adds the missing properties to fix this."

* R-Car H2 (r8a7790) and R-Mobile APE6 (r8a73a4) SoCs
  - Correct mask for GIC PPI interrupts

    Geert Uytterhoeven says "R-Car H2 and R-Mobile APE6 contain four
    Cortex-A15 and four Cortex-A7 cores, hence the second interrupt
    specifier cell for Private Peripheral Interrupts should use
    "GIC_CPU_MASK_SIMPLE(8)", to make sure interrupts can be delivered to
    all 8 processor cores.

    This brings the predecessors of R-Car Gen3 in line with what we're
    doing on other big.LITTLE SoCs, like R-Car H3 and M3-W."

* Alt board for R-Car E2 (r8a7794) SoC

* RBoards for -Car Gen2 SoCs and kzm9d board for EMMA Mobile EV2 (emev2) SoC
  - Drop unnecessary address properties from VIN port nodes

    These are unnecessary as the nodes to not have bus addresses.

* R-Car H2 (r8a7790), M2-W (r8a7791), M2-N (r8a7793) and E2 (r8a7794) SoCs
  - Describe FDP1 instances

* iW-RainboW-G23S board for RZ/G1C (r8a77470) SoC
  - Initial SoC and board support

  - Enable EtherAVB

  - Describe all SCIF devices

* Boards for R-Car Gen2 SoCs
  - Enable watchdog support

    Geert Uytterhoeven says "This patch series enables the builtin watchdog
    timer on R-Car Gen2 SoCs on all supported boards, and builds on top of
    Fabrizio's "[RFC v4 00/26] Fix watchdog on Renesas R-Car Gen2 and
    RZ/G1"."

* R-Car Gen2 and RZ/G1 SoCs
  - Describe watchdog devices

  - For R-Car Gen2 this involves updating the SMP routine side as
    it is changed by a driver updated to allow watchdog device support

* Wheat board for V2H (r8a7792) SoC
  - Correct ADV7513 address usage

    Kieran Bingham says "The r8a7792 Wheat board has two ADV7513 devices
    sharing a single I2C bus, however in low power mode the ADV7513 will
    reset it's slave maps to use the hardware defined default addresses.

    The ADV7511 driver was adapted to allow the two devices to be
    registered correctly - but it did not take into account the fault
    whereby the devices reset the addresses.

    This results in an address conflict between the device using the
    default addresses, and the other device if it is in low-power-mode.

    Repair this issue by moving both devices away from the default address
    definitions."
