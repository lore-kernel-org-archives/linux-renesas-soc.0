So IMO the changes you are proposing make sense regardless of the
genpd issue, because they generally simplify the phy code, but the
additional use_runtime_pm field in struct phy represents redundant
information (manipulating reference counters shouldn't matter if
runtime PM is disabled), so it doesn't appear to be necessary.

[On a related note, I'm not sure why phy tries to intercept runtime PM
errors and "fix up" the reference counters.  That doesn't look right
to me at all.]

That said, the current phy code is not strictly invalid.  While it
looks more complicated than necessary, it doesn't do things documented
as invalid in principle, so saying "The behaviour around the runtime
PM deployment cause some issues during system suspend" in the
changelog is describing the problem from a very specific angle.
Simply put, pm_runtime_force_suspend() and the current phy code cannot
work together and so using them together is a bug.  None of them
individually is at fault, but combining them is incorrect.

Fortunately enough, the phy code can be modified so that it can be
used with pm_runtime_force_suspend() without problems, but picturing
it as "problematic", because it cannot do that today is not entirely
fair IMO.

Thanks,
Rafael
