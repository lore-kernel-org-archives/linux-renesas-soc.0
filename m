There are two ways to save power: disabling the module clock, and powering
down the module logic.

Sure.

I think on some older SH/R-Mobile SoCs you can do something similar,
but even there you have to keep the interrupt controller's power area powered.
This makes sense, given those SoCs also have an SH core, which could be used
as the small co-processor that powers down the whole ARM subsystem and
handles wakeup through the SH subsystem's interrupt controller.

Doesn't re-routing a pin to a GPIO require using pinctrl?

Here the serial device is the wakeup source, but it doesn't handle wakeup
itself...

This one is more tricky, as I think we're already using a GPIO for CD on
many boards.
Then the SD device is the wakeup source, but it doesn't handle wakeup
itself...

So you not only need a flag to opt-in, but also a flag to opt-out?

I think five:

  - drivers/gpio/gpio-rcar.c
  - drivers/irqchip/irq-renesas-intc-irqpin.c
  - drivers/irqchip/irq-renesas-irqc.c
  - drivers/net/ethernet/renesas/ravb_main.c
  - drivers/net/ethernet/renesas/sh_eth.c

Note that while setting the flag wouldn't harm, it would not be necessary for
gpio-rcar and renesas-intc-irqpin when running on R-Car Gen1.  Not setting it
means using platform knowledge in a device driver, which is what genpd was
supposed to solve in the first place, and thus IMHO a layering violation.
