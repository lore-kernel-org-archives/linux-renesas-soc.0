A quick hack is to change arch/arm64/mm/dma-mapping.c:dma_debug_do_init()
from fs_initcall() to arch_initcall().

However, then you loose the debugfs features. A proper fix would involve
splitting dma_debug_init() in two phases: an early one doing the real work,
and a late one registering the debugfs interface.
