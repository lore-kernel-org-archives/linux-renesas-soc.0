There are boards available for the Pi that use the FSA642 to switch
between multiple camera modules [1].
They haven't written any clever drivers as their intended use is
against the (closed) firmware, therefore they currently have to be
identical sensors on each input.
The use of those boards seems to fit pretty cleanly into this
multiplexed CSI bus framework, and there needn't be the limitation of
them being the same sensor.

I acknowledge that the Pi CSI2 receiver driver isn't upstream yet. I
put that on hold as the TC358743 was one of the main devices to be
supported, and without the rest of this patch set passing the number
of lanes in use through then that was pretty dead in the water. It was
less effort to keep the driver in the Pi vendor tree using the
g_mbus_config mechanism that was rejected, rather than holding patches
on an upstreamed driver. Once this set is merged and I can therefore
support TC358743 cleanly I'll be looking again at upstreaming it.

Are you meaning CSI transmitter or receiver for device configuration?
Most receivers support either, but often have to be told which mode to expect.
TC358743 seems to be one of the few CSI drivers that actually supports
both. None of the others appear to quote the use of
clock-noncontinuous in their DT bindings, but that doesn't guarantee
that that is the actual truth.

So there's no issue at the moment, but there will be issues when you
get the first driver that only supports clock-noncontinuous and
someone wants to mux it.

As I said, having the potential for the two ends to be set differently
in device tree and no way to check at runtime seems like an
unnecessary trap for the unwary. You're now adding a config path from
source to receiver, therefore adding that information removes that
confusion. Just a suggestion.
