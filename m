Hi Linus,
     thanks for review

Is it ok then to simply substitute "pinctrl_free_gpio" with 
"gpiochip_generic_free" and keep rz_gpio_direction_input here?

That's funny how a simple addition like this one would require several 
changes (possibly even in the dts ABI defined by this driver).

This is more a question for the original driver author I hope is 
listening here:

To read the pin direction I would need to add one more register to the 
"reg" property range provided in the DTS.
This is of course doable, but I would have two questions here:
- why did you chose to use PMSR register instead of reading/writing 
directly to PM? Am I missing something?
- wouldn't it be better to just receive the port base address from the 
"reg" property and offset from that instead of having the 3 register 
addresses specified in the dts?

See, the dts now looks like this:

reg = <0xfcfe3100 0x4>, /* PSR */
       <0xfcfe3200 0x2>, /* PPR */
       <0xfcfe3800 0x4>; /* PMSR */

Shouldn't we just receive the gpiochip base address and the offset as we 
like?

Thanks
