Hello.

   Here's the set of 11 patches against Simon Horman's 'renesas.git' repo's
'renesas-devel-201611104-v4.9-rc3' tag plus the R8A7743/SK-RZG1M patch series
posted earlier. I'm adding the device tree support for the R8A7745-based
SK-RZG1E board. The SoC is close to R8A7794 and the board seems identical to the
R8A7794/SILK board. The device tree patches depend on the R8A7745 CPG/MSSR
driver series in order to compile and work.
