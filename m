"wakeup-source" in DT is used as a mix of hardware description and software
policy.  E.g. some keys on a keyboard may have it, others don't, while there's
not always a technical reason for that.

Also, it doesn't specify from which suspend state it can wake-up.

On top of that, the Linux PM subsystem allows to configure wakeup by writing
"enabled" to a device's "wakeup" file in sysfs.  Or you can use ethtool for
Wake-on-LAN.
