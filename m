If we reject the request here, I think the PM core has to be modified to
try again using a shallower state. Note that it would be better to reject
the state in the .valid() callback instead of in .enter().

You also have to consider this is dynamic not static.
I.e. the availability of other wake-up sources may change at runtime (cfr.
the "wakeup" files in sysfs). Currently pm_sleep_states[] (which controls
which states are available) is initialized from suspend_set_ops(), and not
changed later.

Perhaps pm_sleep_states[] should be updated every time the wakeup_sources
list is changed?

You mean the wakeup source that actually wakes up the system from PSCI
SYSTEM_SUSPEND? On Renesas boards, that's a switch wired to the PMIC,
and currently not described in DT.  Describing it in DT could indeed interfere
with wakeup_source_available() :-(

Right.  And that information should come from DT?

Thanks!
