My recollection is that in the beginning we had a bit of a mixture but
leaned towards <ip>-<soc>, which made sense in my opinion. However, after
some discussion it was agreed that the best-practice for upstream was to
use <soc>-<ip>. Unless that situation has changed lets stock with using
<soc>-<ip> for new bindings.
