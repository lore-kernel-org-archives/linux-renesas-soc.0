    What does he mean by that? The adjust_link() is surely called as a result 
of interrogating the PHY...

    Things are not that simple with this signal. The main cause of the issues 
is that it's connected to a LED control output of the Micrel PHY and that one 
may have different meaning -- e.g., it can well be blinking when some traffic 
happens (and IIRC that's might be a problem with KSZ9031, usually used with 
AVB). I remember I have tried without this option but finally decided to leave 
it specified as my schematics reading skills failed me in this case... I need 
to test this patch.
