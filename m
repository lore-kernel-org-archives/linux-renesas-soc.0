As per our discussion on IRC this morning I have queued up the following.
We can revisit the remaining patches once the issues described above
are resolved one way or another.

ARM: dts: alt: use demuxer for I2C4
ARM: dts: gose: use demuxer for I2C4
ARM: dts: koelsch: use demuxer for I2C4
ARM: dts: koelsch: use demuxer for I2C1
ARM: dts: lager: use demuxer for IIC1/I2C1
ARM: dts: lager: rename and reindex i2cexio
