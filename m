In my renesas-drivers it does.
In Simon's renesas/devel it doesn't, as the R8A77995_PD_* definitions
go upstream through a different branch than the DTS changes.

For now you should use 32.
However, as soon as Simon merges v4.14-rc1 into renesas/devel, you
can start on using R8A77995_PD_ALWAYS_ON.
As that is expected to happen this Monday, he can just postpone applying
your updated patch until then, so I don't think there's a need to resend a
version with hardcoded numbers.

For R-Car V3M it's different, as the definitions for that SoC won't appear
in upstream for another full cycle, i.e. in v4.15-rc1 the earliest.
