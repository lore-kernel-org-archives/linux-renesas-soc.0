Well, not quite.

The sysfs wakeup setting for devices only means whether or not to
enable the generation of wakeup signals for them while suspending.  It
allows to *prevent* devices from waking up the system, but it doesn't
guarantee that they will actually wake up if enabled.

Now, the platform doesn't decide on the sleep state it will go to on
the basis of what devices have been enabled to wake up the system.
The states ("shallow", "deep") have to be defined upfront, including
what devices can wake up from the "shallow" and what devices can wake
up from the "deep" states (these lists need not be the same).  [As I
said before, the assumption is that all of them will be able to wake
up the system from suspend-to-idle.]

So, if user space triggers a transition to the "shallow" state, say,
it will be possible to wake up the system from it by devices that (a)
can wake it up from the "shallow" state as defined for the given
platform and (b) have been enabled to wake up the system via sysfs.

Conversely, if you have a system power state such that only a subset
of devices can wake up from it, it needs to be defined as either
"shallow" or "deep" and the list of possible wakeup sources is part of
that definition.

Thanks,
Rafael
