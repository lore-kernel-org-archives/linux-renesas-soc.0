TL;DR: Sounds fine, I'll be on the lookout for the PR.

Longer version: Let me step back a bit and actually think about
this longer than 2 minutes. From what I see
rcar_rst_read_mode_pins() already returns -ENODEV if the nodes
aren't present. Great.

So clk tree could be given a pull for the clk patches, part C, on
top of part A, the reset driver. If the rcar_rst_read_mode_pins()
returns failure because the node is missing, we fall back to the
old style of doing things. Some drivers already do that anyway,
so this looks to be replacing things like 

	if (rcar_rst_read_mode_pins())
		return;
		
with
	
	if (rcar_rst_read_mode_pins() != -ENODEV)
		return;


Then in arm-soc tree, the dts patches are merged. That causes us
to do some duplicate work reading the pins twice in mach-shmobile
and in the new reset driver. That's duplicate/wasteful, but it
works. Finally, everything is merged together into a tagged
release. The mach-shmobile changes can happen anytime after that
(part D). Again we're left with dead code in the clk driver (part
E) until the dependency merges, but that's ok. Once part D merges
we can get rid of the dead code in part E and any backwards
compatibility we don't want to maintain.

In summary, it's all feasible to do this and most people wouldn't
have had to know about the dependency chain but it's not fast by
any means. Instead we merge everything in one shot and get it
over with now.
