Hi all,

Thanks for your comments.

I can explain the use case and maybe we can figure out if this approach 
is the correct one to solve it.

The problem is that I have devices behind an IOMMU which I would like to 
use with DMA. Vinod recently moved forward with his and Linus Walleij
patch '[PATCH] dmaengine: use phys_addr_t for slave configuration' which 
clarifies that the DMA slave address provided by a client is the 
physical address. This puts the task of mapping the DMA slave address 
from a phys_addr_t to a dma_addr_t on the DMA engine.

Without an IOMMU this is easy since the phys_addr_t and dma_addr_t are 
the same and no special care is needed. However if you have a IOMMU you 
need to map the DMA slave phys_addr_t to a dma_addr_t using something 
like this. Is it not very similar to dma_map_single() where one maps 
processor virtual memory (instead if MMIO) so that it can be used with 
DMA slaves?
