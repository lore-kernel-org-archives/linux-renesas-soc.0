To do things correctly of course.

If you follow this argument through, you could say we should start
plucking out random files from /proc because someone might cluelessly
misuse them. This might lead to a system that's hard to misuse indeed,
but likely also quite useless.

Technically it does. Consider the fact that those flashes have between
4-64 MiB in size and sector size of 256 kiB . If you waste one sector on
the 4 MiB flash for some sort of partition table, you waste 1/16th of
the flash, which is a lot.

The bootloader needs to know the flash layout and it must be in sync
with the kernel, so there has to be some sort of communication channel
between those two. I don't want to add handler for every possible
bootloader that can be used on those platforms into the kernel though.

How so ? /dev/sdxy remains /dev/sdxy . Sure, you can use UUID and change
it, but that's a specific case.

In this case it doesn't matter either, since you have only one flash device.
