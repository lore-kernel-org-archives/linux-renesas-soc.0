The commit 05484e098448 ("sched/topology: Add SD_ASYM_CPUCAPACITY
flag detection") to automatically detect asymmetric CPU capacity
has been merged into v4.20-rc1, so I will post this patch series
as v2 again.

These add the scheduler information to be aware cpu capacity. Some
R-Car SoCs have big LITTLE architecture(e.g. CA57/CA53). It has a
difference performance/power consumption for each CPUs.

As the scheduler will be aware the capacity of CPU, the scheduler is
balancing so that the free capacity of each CPU is even. This means
that it aggressively migrates tasks to big CPUs(e.g. CA57) with large
capacity in case of the system load is low and middle, the performance
of user application is improved than before.

Since most users for IVI are using CPU with performance oriented than
power consumption, this change will benefit for their use-cases. Some
benchmark is improved as an example below.

based on renesas-devel-20181105-v4.20-rc1

v1 -> v2:
 - Consolidate two patches for r8a7795 and r8a7796 into one patch
 - Add the formula for capacity-dmips-mhz into description
 - Remove the static setting of SD_ASYM_CPUCAPACITY for R-Car
