Hi Geert,

Thanks for reviewing, much appreciated!

Right, that would work! However, to me, I don't think it's fine grained enough.

Let's take the Ethernet device/driver using WoL as an example, similar
to your cases.

First, let's assume device_may_wakeup() returns true, meaning that the
Ethernet device is wakeup capable and that userspace has requested
wakeup to be enabled.

Then we have three scenarios to consider when the Ethernet driver
becomes suspended (typically when its ->suspend() callback gets
invoked).
1) The Ethernet interface is down.
2) The Ethernet interface is up, but no connection established.
3) The Ethernet interface is up, connection established.

By following your approach, using GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP, would mean
that we can't distinguish between any of the the scenarios above, but
instead always keep the Ethernet device powered on and thus the PM
domain also.

In the more fine grained solution, we can change the Ethernet driver
to consider under what scenario it's being suspended. For 1) and 2),
there is no need to keep the Ethernet device being powered, but
instead only enable WoL in 3) - via also using the WAKEUP_POWERED
flag.

Right.

First, is that really that many? Second, nothing prevent us from doing
the migration of each driver in step by step.

Kind regards
