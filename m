Indeed. Recently there have been some attempts to fix this.

Note that your file includes

    #include <dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h>
    #include <dt-bindings/pinctrl/r7s9210-pinctrl.h>

both of which are

   include/dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h:/* SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0 */
   include/dt-bindings/pinctrl/r7s9210-pinctrl.h:/*
SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0 */

Documentation/process/license-rules.rst does have SPDX identifiers for
dual-licensed files.  Perhaps they match the license of your file?
