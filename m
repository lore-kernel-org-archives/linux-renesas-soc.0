We already have the clocks for (H)SCIF (_BUS, not _MAIN!):

    #define R8A78000_CPG_SGASYNCD4_PERW_BUS         0
    #define R8A78000_CPG_SGASYNCD8_PERW_BUS         1

This hasn't changed much: on other R-Car generations we also didn't
know which clock(s) are gated by a single MSTP (Module SToP) bit.
Historically (old SH parts), there was only a single clock supplying
each module. Modules on later SoCs gained more clock supplies.
Hence we always assumed (at least) the functional clock is gated by
the MSTP bit, and modelled the gateable SMTP clocks as a child of the
functional clock parent.  But it's quite possible other clock inputs
to the module are gated, too, depending on the actual module (some
modules e.g. need a PHY clock running to be able to process wake-up
events).

Comparing older R-Car with R-Car Gen5, I actually like how the new
MDLC block combines the power domain functionality of the old SYSC
block and the clock domain functionality of the old MSSR (Module Standby
and Software Reset) block. It improves upon the now imprecise modelling
of MSTP clocks, and maps nicely on the Linux PM Domain abstraction:
  - power domain: generic_pm_domain.power_{on,off}(domain),
  - clock domain: generic_pm_domain.dev_ops.{start,stop}(device).

The functional clock (or its parent) is still listed in the clocks
property.  Compare e.g. the hscif0 nodes on R-Car V4H:

    clocks = <&cpg CPG_MOD 514>,
             <&cpg CPG_CORE R8A779G0_CLK_SASYNCPERD1>,
             <&scif_clk>;
    clock-names = "fck", "brg_int", "scif_clk";
    power-domains = <&sysc R8A779G0_PD_ALWAYS_ON>;
    resets = <&cpg 514>;

and R-Car X5H:

    clocks = <&cpg R8A78000_CPG_SGASYNCD4_PERW_BUS>,
             <&cpg R8A78000_CPG_SGASYNCD4_PERW_BUS>,
             <&scif_clk>;
    clock-names = "fck", "brg_int", "scif_clk";
    power-domains = <&mdlc_perw R8A78000_MDLC_PD_APL 0x54>;
    resets = <&mdlc_perw 0x54>;

On R-Car V4H, MSTP514 aka "hscif0" is modelled as a gateable MSTP
clock with parent R8A779G0_CLK_SASYNCPERD1, and used as "fck".
On R-Car X5H, R8A78000_CPG_SGASYNCD4_PERW_BUS is used as "fck" directly.
Calling clk_get_rate() on MSTP514 and R8A78000_CPG_SGASYNCD4_PERW_BUS
gives similar results.

Yes, you need a public ID to refer to a clock from DT.
Do you have an example where we would assigned-clock-rates it for a PLL?
So far all users of assigned-clock-rates on Renesas SoCs use it
on clocks that are already public as they are also needed as clock
supplies in clocks properties (e.g. CAN-FD and SPI reference clocks).

We could, but which one: "_PERW_BUS" or "_PERW_MAIN"? Or both?
And what's the point if there are no users?

BTW, there are 87 SGD4_* clocks listed in the documentation.  They are
all sourced from the same PLL, and have all the same clock rate.
I don't think any of these can be gated.  Hence if I would write a
bare metal clock driver, I would just expose and instantiate a single
SGD4 clock.  But the current SCMI implementation exposes 87 different
clocks (and didn't make them usable by Linux until recently)...

Perhaps we should drop the domain suffixes from the definitions? Even
e.g. MSOCK_PERW_BUS and MSOCK_PERW_MAIN seem to be the same clock...
