I rely on Geert Uytterhoeven and Laurent Pinchart to tell me
what is best for Renesas.

A good hint is that Geert will merge this driver when finished and
send it to me, so if he's not happy it is unlikely to get merged.
So make sure Geert is happy and I will be happy too.

Geert, as I, likely rely on the DT maintainers to tell me what is
best for DT. But with pinctrl they often pass it back to us.
