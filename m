Yes it returns the true state of the output pin.
I admit it's a bit odd from the classic GPIO point of view.

Yes. They're both driven push/pull, but the try state of the line is available.

I know of one other doing the same thing with the core in the Altera SocFPGA platform.
As they put me on to this solution for doing the recovery when the i2c was routed thru the SOC's fpga.

In other hard configurations they may have a 'proper' GPIO available that needs to be OpenDrain.
