Subject: [PATCH v2 0/2] ARM: dts: r7s72100: add sdhi DT
Date: Mon, 26 Sep 2016 16:40:30 -0400
Message-Id: <20160926204032.12260-1-chris.brandt@renesas.com>
Sender: linux-renesas-soc-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-renesas-soc.vger.kernel.org>

SUMMARY:
This series adds sdhi to the r7s72100 (RZ/A1) Device Tree.

DEPENDECIES:
This series is dependent on the tmio/sh_sdhi patches being
applied to add r7s72100 support.
  mmc: sh_mobile_sdhi: add ocr_mask option
  mmc: tmio-mmc: add support for 32bit data port
  mmc: sh_mobile_sdhi: Add r7s72100 support

MERGE CONFLICTS:
There are also patches being reviewed for adding mmc so depending on how
they get applied, there might be a line conflict.
To resolve the merge conflict, simply put the MMC nodes before
the SDHI nodes (just because that seems to be the order in other
Renesas SoCs DTs)

CHANGES:
V1->V2
* Removed patch "[PATCH 1/3] ARM: dts: r7s72100: add sdhi clock to device tree"
  because it has already been queued up
* moved bus-with property from dtsi to dts


Chris Brandt (2):
  ARM: dts: r7s72100: add sdhi to device tree
  ARM: dts: rskrza1: add sdhi1 DT support
