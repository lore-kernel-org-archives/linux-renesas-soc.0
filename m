Sorry I meant "one patch". As a workaround it is fine, but dropping
one patch still does not change the way the hardware is designed.
Being able to change the I2C master controller between the on-chip I2C
device and the on-chip IIC device is still something that the hardware
supports but we cannot seem to do without further software
development.

Thanks,
