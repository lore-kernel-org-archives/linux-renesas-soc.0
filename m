Sounds reasonable, saves the need to change the process. Sure it feels
strange to make a new release with only 2 commits since the previous
release, OTOH we have a regression in one of the tools, which is
something rare (thankfully) and problematic enough to justify a rush of
schedule.

I'll take care of that ASAP if that's OK with you. If you have any
other change that should make it into 4.3, now is the time to commit it.
