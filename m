Subject: [PATCH] i2c: algo-bit: init the bus to a known state
Date: Mon,  4 Dec 2017 09:16:18 +0100

Ensure the bus is free when we register the adapter. Before the SCL/SDA
wires were in an unknown state. It used to work because sending a byte
has a retry mechanism which was triggered if the bus was initially in a
not-free state. But the graceful way to do it is to initialize
correctly, of course.

Found while working with the I2C GPIO fault injector. SCL was initially low
before, so it only worked on the second try.
