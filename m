Here are my first thoughts, based on 4.15-rc7:

Question to Rob and Frank: should of_attach_node() be called directly, or
should it be called indirectly by creating a change set that adds the node?

Frank's off the cuff answer (but would like to think more about it): since
the driver is modifying its own devicetree data, and thus no other entity
needs to be notified about the changes, there is no need to add the complexity
of using a change set.

The following is how of_attach_node() could be modified to dynamically create
a phandle on request.


of_attach_node()

   Add parameter: int create_phandle

   of_attach_node(): pass create_phandle to __of_attach_node().

   Modify existing callers of of_attach_node(): use value of 0 (zero)
   for create_phandle.

   rcar caller of of_attach_node(): use value of 1 for create_phandle.


__of_attach_node()

   Add parameter: int create_phandle

   if (create_phandle)
      - protect creating value of new phandle and inserting the node with 
        of_overlay_mutex_lock() / of_overlay_mutex_unlock()
      - if phandle does not exist, then phandle = live_tree_max_phandle() + 1

   Notice that there will not actually be a phandle property created for the
   node.  Instead the phandle value will only exist in the struct device_node.
   We are trying to move in this direction for all phandles, but have not yet
   gotten there.

   Modify existing callers of __of_attach_node(): use value of 0 (zero)
   for create_phandle.

   (If a change set is used to add the node instead of calling
   of_attach_node(), then the change set code would have to be modified to
   expose the create_phandle parameter to of_changeset_attach_node() and
   related code.)
