Subject: [PATCH 1/2] ARM: dts: r8a7793: add CAN clocks
Date: Thu, 21 Jan 2016 14:09:40 +0900
Message-Id: <1453352981-16104-2-git-send-email-horms+renesas@verge.net.au>
In-Reply-To: <1453352981-16104-1-git-send-email-horms+renesas@verge.net.au>
References: <1453352981-16104-1-git-send-email-horms+renesas@verge.net.au>
List-ID: <linux-renesas-soc.vger.kernel.org>

The R-Car CAN controllers can derive the CAN bus clock not only from their
peripheral clock input (clkp1) but also from the other internal clock
(clkp2) and external clock fed on CAN_CLK pin. Describe those clocks in
the device tree along with  the USB_EXTAL clock from which clkp2 is
derived.

Based on work by Sergei Shtylyov for the r8a7791 SoC.
