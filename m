Oops. I got it.

I don't understand the first one now... This means the renesas_usb3 should =
follow
USB connector binding and have 2 endpoints for the usb role switch to avoid
the conflict like below?
 - port1@0: Super Speed (SS), present in SS capable connectors (from usb-co=
nnector.txt).
 - port1@1: USB3.0 host port.

About the 'companion' in usb-generic.txt, the property intends to be used f=
or EHCI or host side
like the commit log [1]. If there is accept to use 'companion' for this pat=
ch, I think it will
be simple to achieve this role switch feature. However, in last month, I su=
bmitted a similar patch [2]
that has "renesas,host" property, but I got reply from Andy [3] and Heikki =
[4]. So, I'm
trying to improve the device connection framework [5] now.
