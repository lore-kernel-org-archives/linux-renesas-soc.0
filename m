	Hi Simon, Magnus,

This patch series adds support for the Baud Rate Generator for External
Clock (BRG), as found on SCIF and HSCIF, to the DTS files for all R-Car
Gen1, Gen2, and Gen3 SoCs. This increases the range and accuracy of
supported baud rates on (H)SCIF.

Support for the extra clocks in the DT bindings and in the driver has
been accepted in v4.5-rc1.  

Changes compared to v3:
  - Change one-line summary prefix to match current arm-soc practices,
  - Rebased,

Changes compared to v2:
  - Rename "int_clk" to "brg_int",
  - Add support for R-Car M1A (r8a7778) and R-Car H1 (r8a7779),
  - Add support for R-Car H2 (r8a7790), R-Car M2-N (r8a7793), and R-Car
    E2 (r8a7794),
  - Correct internal clock source ZS_CLK to S3D1 in patch description
    for r8a7795, 

This has been tested on r8a7778/bockw, r8a7779/marzen, r8a7791/koelsch,
r8a7794/alt, and r8a7795/salvator-x.

Dependencies:
  - renesas-devel-20160129-v4.5-rc1,
  - series "[PATCH v4 0/7] ARM: dts: R-Car: Add SCIF fallback
    compatibility strings",
  - series "[PATCH v4 00/11] ARM: dts: shmobile: Rename the serial port
    clock to fck",

Thanks for applying!

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
