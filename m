OK, thanks.

This one was special, as it was about moving functionality from platform
code to DT, complicated by a bad design decision when introducing DT and
CCF on mach-shmobile a few years ago. Hence, the presence of the "bad"
way was complicating doing it the "good" way when adding support for new SoCs.

To avoid breaking existing setups, all steps had to be done in lockstep.
Hence we went for the single branch.
Untangling that by subsystem/maintainer would have taken 4 kernel releases.

Thanks for your understanding!
