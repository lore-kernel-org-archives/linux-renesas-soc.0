Indeed. While I'm a big fan of DT overlays, I don't think they're suitable for
all kinds of fixups we need.
Simple things like adding a device node for the RST could be handled with a
built-in overlay.
More complex things, like adding SYSC and APMU devices nodes need some
extra bit of logic, to e.g. add phandles to/from the (existing) CPU nodes.
The same is true for fixups that need to check on which revision of the SoC
they're running.

OK. So I should try to hook up my code immediately after
unflatten_device_tree()...
