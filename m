While I think the current patch is a bit of a hack I still like to to some 
extend, so I'm not requesting APIs to muck with OF internals instead of using 
the overlay API. It's entirely up to you and Frank (and other OF core 
developers). I'm fine with either way, all I know is that I need a solution 
:-)

Do you mean fixing them up in the parsed overlay before applying it, or 
manually in the live device tree after applying the overlay ?

Again I'm fine either way.
