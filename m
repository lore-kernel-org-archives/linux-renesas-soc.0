Both ;-)

Google and Patchwork told me this was enabled in the old board code for Lager:

  commit b77c6bcef2082a7cd96124daf15df8da5b670ebe
  Author: Guennadi Liakhovetski <g.liakhovetski@gmx.de>
  Date:   Wed Jul 10 21:21:17 2013 +0200

    ARM: shmobile: lager: disable MMCIF Command Completion Signal, add CLK_CTRL2

    MMCIF on r8a7790 doesn't support Command Completion Signal, but it does
    implement a CE_CLK_CTRL2 register. Platform parameters have to be added to
    account for these features on lager.

But it was lost during the transition to DT. No idea if someone tried MMC
(not SDHI) on Lager, or any other R-Car Gen2 board, recently...

Let's summarize...

  1) Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mmc/renesas,mmcif.txt should document
     the "interrupts" property, for both single and multiple values.
  2) If you specify 2 interrupts in DT, the driver names the first one
     "sh_mmc:error", and the second one "sh_mmc:int", while you specified them
     in reverse order (status first, error second).
     I couldn't find which of the three interrupts on R-Mobile A1 is used for
     what purpose in the datasheet, but the datasheet for SH-Mobile AG5 states
     the first (140) is MMC_ERR, and the second (141) is MMC_NOR.
     However, it still worked for you, as the driver uses the same interrupt
     handler for all interrupts.
  3) You may want to add the card detect interrupt to DT anyway, as DT
     describes the hardware, not limitations of the driver. If you do so,
     renesas,mmcif.txt should document the third interrupt value.

Wolfram, do you have any comments?

Thanks!
