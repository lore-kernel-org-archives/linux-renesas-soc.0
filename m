Thanks for your patch!

While the recommended debug method these days is "earlycon", DEBUG_LL is
indeed still useful to debug issues before earlycon is initialized.
Let's hope you will never encounter such issues on arm64, which doesn't
have DEBUG_LL per policy decision...

This line is becoming a bit long, and it'll only become worse in the future.
What about "Kernel low-level debugging messages via SCIF0 on R-Car Gen2"?
The full list of SoCs is still available in the extended help text.
