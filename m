This is a interesting finding, I did some bisecting a while back to try 
and understand why a known problematic SD card started to have more 
issues then last time I tested it. That investigation also ended up 
pointing to 52ad9a8e854c.

Can you post that hack or just send it to me privately if it's to 
hackish for a mailinglist :-) I'm still interested in my problematic SD 
card and would just like to see what happens with your hack applied.
