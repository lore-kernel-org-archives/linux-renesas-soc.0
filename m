Right, but the content free bit still applies (as does the bit about
resending which is the main actionable bit for people).  The two go hand
in hand so often that I just wrote the one thing for both.

They're not content free.  They're telling people that if it looks like
their patch has fallen through the cracks then they need to resend their
patch and why, without that people (especially newer contributors) might
not be clear about what to do.

If that's the tlv320dac33 patch you sent a followup in the middle of the
thread with what you said was a current version or something but never
actually sent that version as a regular patch submission.  You'd also
managed to not have the ASoC on the front of the patch which pushes it
to the bottom of the review queue, it won't turn up when I look in in my
inbox for ASoC patches.

Now, I for whatever reason didn't explicitly tell you I was expecting a
resend so you didn't explicitly know that this was what was going on
which is a good example of why letting people know what's going on is a
good idea.
