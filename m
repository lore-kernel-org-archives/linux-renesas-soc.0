Yes, it is, In the working state of the system.  In the system wakeup
case it may not be.

Essentially, what happens then is that driver-provided interrupt
handlers don't run as a rule and system wakeup is triggered by the
low-level handler at the IRQ chip level.  Next, the PM callbacks
invoked for the device are expected to clean up the wakeup status etc.

Of course, power still is necessary for that to work, but it may be
not be in-band.  That may be either in-band power used for normal
operations and provided through the interconnect used by the device or
it may be special wakeup power provided out-of-band.

Also the wakeup signal itself may be an in-band device interrupt (like
the ones used for signaling IO events during normal operation) or it
may be a special wakeup signal (like PCI PME) in which case, from the
driver's perspective, the wakeup signaling is out-of-band.

Usually, the driver doesn't know how this is set up for the particular
device in the particular platform and hence my question. :-)

The case at hand seems to be when the wakeup power is in-band or the
wakeup signal is an in-band interrupt (in which case power needs to be
provided to the interconnect at least).

If they both are out-of-band, the middle layer should know that,
because as a rule it will be involved in setting up both of them.
Otherwise, in principle, it should assume that in-band power needs to
be provided for wakeup to work and avoid turning things off if wakeup
is enabled.

But then it is not expected to generate wakeup signals I suppose.

[BTW, I wonder how it detects when the cable is connected again to it.
I know what happens in PCI NICs, but that clearly is not the case
here.]

Well, anyway, it looks like the case when the device is
runtime-suspended right before system suspend and it is going to stay
suspended is not interesting here, because the state will be retained
whatever it is then.

An interesting case seems to be when the device is not
runtime-suspended when system suspend triggers.

I was thinking about something like DPM_FLAG_IN_BAND_WAKEUP or similar.

But please note that there are cases in which the middle layer has
information on what power states to put devices into for wakeup to
work and IMO that should take precedence over the flag as a rule.

Right.
