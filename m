Subject: [PATCH 0/2] ARM: dts: shmobile: Correct interrupt type for ARM TWD

	Hi Simon, Magnus, Jon,

This patch series corrects the interrupt type for ARM TWD timers on
SH-Mobile AG5 and R-Car H1.

The ARM TWD interrupt is a private peripheral interrupt (PPI), and per
the ARM GIC documentation, whether the type for PPIs can be set is
IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED.

For SH-Mobile AG5 and R-Car H1 devices the PPI type cannot be set, and
so when we attempt to set the type for the ARM TWD interrupt it fails.
This has gone unnoticed because it fails silently, and because we cannot
re-configure the type it has had no impact. Nevertheless fix the type
for the TWD interrupt so that it matches the hardware configuration.

This was exposed by Jon Hunter's "[PATCH 04/15] irqchip/gic: WARN if
setting the interrupt type fails" (https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/3/17/339),
which triggers:

    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 0 at drivers/irqchip/irq-gic-common.c:61 gic_configure_irq+0x64/0x7c()

Other Renesas SoCs using private peripheral interrupts (R-Mobile APE6,
R-Car Gen2, and R-Car Gen3) seem to be fine.

Based on patches by Jon Hunter for Tegra20/30 and OMAP4.

Thanks!
