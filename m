Well the input is fixed frequency -- and there is a clock (gate)
created for it in the driver
(CLK_RGMII_REF) so you can turn it on/off if you like...

The only configurable bit is a *nightmare* as the selection bit for
whether it is coming
from CLKOUT_D8 or from an external input is in a *completely different
IP block*. I'd
need another iomap() and all that stuff, and a custom driver for it.

If I were to implement it, I'd have to add a custom driver for that
clock, use the current
gate as a parent, iomap the selection bit register etc -- basically.
All of that for a use
case of *none ever* as most people would probably tweak that bit in
the bootloader
anyway -- also, I'd have zero capability for testing it.

As far as the output, they also have their own gates (already
created). They are also fixed
frequency and the only thing that matters to them is the pinmux
settings. So (soon) with the
pinmux driver, you can enable that clock properly without a special
driver, just by adding
that gate to your ethernet, and add the pinmux config for it.

So what do I go with that?

I copied it straight out of clk-rcar-gen2.c -- I don't 'need' anything more than
instantiating my driver; does it make a difference? ie a one liner macro vs
adding an extra struct, 2 functions to do the same thing?
Just curious, sometime I lose track of that the goalpost is -- for
years I understood
that having OF was simpler and better all around?

Thanks!
Michel
