Just for the record, I've been bitten in the past by applying one of Markus' 
patches that seemed to make sense, only to discover later that it introduced a 
security hole. I now drop his patches altogether, so could you please keep an 
eye open to make sure none of them touching the rcar-du driver will be applied 
through drm-misc ?
