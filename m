This series contains updated r8a7795 support for the IPMMU driver
compared to the earlier series posted as:

[PATCH 00/10] iommu/ipmmu-vmsa: Initial r8a7795 support

The DT binding for r8a7795 has been accepted for upstream merge
and this series implements support following such format:

d4e42e7 iommu/ipmmu-vmsa: Add r8a7795 DT binding

The r8a7795 IPMMU is almost register compatible with earlier devices
like r8a7790-r8a7794, however some bitfields have been shifted
slightly. On a grander scale topology has been added and interrupts
have been reworked. So now there are several "cache" IPMMU units
without interrupt that somehow communicate with IPMMU-MM that
is the only instance that supports interrupts. The code refers to
IPMMU-MM as a "root" device and the other ones as leaf nodes.

To make this more interesting the IPMMU driver needs to be shared
between 32-bit ARM for r8a7790-r8a7794 and 64-bit ARM for r8a7795.
In practice this means that two separate implementations are needed
inside the driver to attach to the rather different architecture
specific code.

CONFIG_IOMMU_DMA=y is needed on 64-bit ARM while on 32-bit ARM
the arch specific dma-mapping code is hooked up rather directly.
During init 64-bit ARM IPMMU support is relying on IOMMU_OF_DECLARE().

This version of the code is known to build on 32-bit and 64-bit ARM.

Compared to V1 the patches have been reordered and multi context
and iommu group code has been reworked. Now devices are grouped
together based on the IPMMU they are connected to. For detail
please see the change log in each individual patch.
