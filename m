I assumed L1 entry has to be negotiated depending upon the PCIe
hierarchy capabilities, I would appreciate if you can explain to
me what's the root cause of the issue please.

I wonder why this can't be done in a PM restore hook but that's not
really where my question is.

I do not get why you need to add the DLLP check for _every_ given config
access and how/why it is just related to suspend/resume and not eg cold
boot (I supposed it is because devices can enter L1 upon suspend(?)), I
would ask you please to provide a thorough explanation so that I can
actually review this patch (the commit log must be rewritten nonetheless,
I do not think it is clear, at least it is not for me).

Thanks,
Lorenzo
