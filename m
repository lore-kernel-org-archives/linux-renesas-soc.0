  ARM: dts: r8a7745: Add missing clock for secondary CA7 CPU core (2017-12-22 09:24:00 +0100)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Second Round of Renesas ARM Based SoC DT Updates for v4.16

* r8a7745 (RZ/G1E) SoC
  - Enable SMP

    Fabrizio Castro says "Add DT node for the Advanced Power Management
    Unit (APMU), add the second CPU core, and use "renesas,apmu" as
    "enable-method"."

* r8a7743 (RZ/G1M) SoC
  - Add node for thermal sensor module with thermal-zone support

* r8a7743 (RZ/G1M) and r8a7745 (RZ/G1E) SoCs
  - Add:
    + Renesas Core Match Timer (CMT) support
    + Renesas Timer Pulse Unit PWM Controller (TPU) support
    + Renesas PWM Timer Controller (PWM) support

* r8a7743 (RZ/G1M) iW-RainboW-G20D-Qseven and
  r8a7745 (RZ/G1E) iW-RainboW-G22D development platforms
  - Add sound support

* r8a7743 (RZ/G1M), r8a7745 (RZ/G1E) and r8a7792 (R-Car V2H) SoCs
  - Allow DTBs of boards of these SoCs to build without any warnings when
    compiled with W=1 using gcc-linaro-5.4.1-2017.05
    + Move nodes which have no reg property out of bus, they don't belong there
    + Also sort sub-nodes of root node to allow for easier maintenance

* r8a7790 (R-Car H2), r8a7791 (R-Car M2-W) and r8a7793 (R-Car M2-N) SoCs
  - Correct critical CPU temperature

    Chris Paterson says "The current R-Car Gen2 device trees define the CPU
    critical temperature as 115°C.

    The R-Car hardware manuals state that Tc = –40°C to +105°C. The thermal
    sensor has an accuracy of ±5°C and there can be a temperature
    difference of 1 or 2 degrees between Tjmax and the thermal sensor due
    to the location of the latter.

    This means that 95°C is a safer value to use.

    This value should also apply to r8a7792 but thermal sensor support has
    not been added yet."

* r8a7740 (R-Mobile A1) SoC
  - Correct TPU register block size

    Geert Uytterhoven says "The Timer Pulse Unit has registers that lie
    outside the declared register block.  Enlarge the register block size to
    fix this.

    This was probably based on the old platform code, which also assumed a
    register block size of 0x100."
