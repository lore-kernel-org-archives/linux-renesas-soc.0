Well, that's a conundrum.  I don't know which devices depend on PME polling
and whether they may signal PME between freezing the workqueue and suspending
the host bridge.  If this unexpectedly turns out to be a problem in practice,
it might be possible to solve it by calling pci_pme_list_scan() once directly
from one of the host bridge's pm_ops callbacks.

I've amended the commit message with the tags and additional information
provided by you and Geert and will resend the patch to the list shortly.

Thanks,

Lukas
