Yeah, that's why I asked: setup-r7s72100.c is the smallest setup file.

It uses shmobile_init_delay() to preset loops-per-jiffy, to avoid
calibrating the
delay loop, and shmobile_init_late() to make s2ram do more than s2idle.
As RZ/A doesn't have SMP, and thus there's no use for disabling secondary
CPU cores, the impact of the latter is small (read: I don't know what's the real
impact of calling cpu_idle_poll_ctrl()).

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
