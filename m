More fun to come ;)

So one element of the implementation is a problem.
Because of the dynamic gain adjustment you are doing in the driver (which I
rather like BTW) there will be instabilities in the computed values that
userspace comes up with when we are near a transition for in the current
sense amplifier gain.  We can't do that as crazy outputs will result
(read offset and scale for possible different values of that gain then
read the actual ADC value for a possible 3rd choice resulting in complete
garbage).

So there are two ways to avoid this:
1. Move all that magic into the original reads and apply the gain and offset
before they get to userspace.
2. Provide enough information for userspace to be able to compute everything
iff it is using buffered mode with a 'scan' covering all the channels in one
go.  Even then we'd have to explicitly allow reading of the PGA gain as a
channel, or make userspace responsible for doing your autogain stuff.

1 is probably easier but will make implementing 2 as a follow up will be tricky
and would be needed if you want to read this stuff faster than sysfs will
allow. 

It's a shame, but my gut feeling is you want to drop the autogain stuff
as then it all becomes straight forward.

What do others think?
