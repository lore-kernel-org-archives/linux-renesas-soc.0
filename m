I think the comment here could be improved. I think if you replace the
last sentence by:

	If not found (i.e. either there is no "clock-names" property or
	the "clock-names" property doesn't include the name to look up),
	the function will try the parent node and so on until ...

Other than that I think the patch is fine, but maybe it would be easier
to review if you split it in two patches. The first patch to implement
the changed behaviour you mention in the warning above and only then the
addition of the optional handling.

Best regards
Uwe
