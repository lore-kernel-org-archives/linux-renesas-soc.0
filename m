Ben: Thanks for your patch!

These are fixes for sparse warnings, and look fine to me.
However, it seems "core.h" should be included by all the remaining
drivers/pinctrl/sh-pfc/pfc-sh* files for ARCH=sh, too.
At which point I start to question: why not merge core.h with sh_pfc.h?

i could take it through sh-pfc-for-v4.8.
I expect more pfc stuff to follow soon anyway.
