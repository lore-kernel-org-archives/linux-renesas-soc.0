Thank you for the clarification.

The CAN interface for r8a7795/6 does not support DMA.

With CAN FD there is currently a H/W issue that means DMA is unusable. Pote=
ntially this issue could be fixed in the future and DMA support could be ad=
ded to the driver. If this happens I can see no reason why the CAN FD IP wo=
uldn't be able to handle DMA transfers when using 64bit addressing.

Yes, it functions fine. We have already tested this with the Renesas v3.3.2=
 BSP with >4Gb memory.

If this is explanation okay for you, I'll proceed with a v2 splitting off t=
he DT bindings documentation.

Kind regards, Chris
