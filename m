Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: r8a779x: Add '#reset-cells' in cpg-mssr
Date: Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:35:57 +0100
Message-Id: <1510839357-11450-1-git-send-email-geert+renesas@glider.be>
Sender: linux-renesas-soc-owner@vger.kernel.org

From: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>

With the latest dtc, we get many warnings about the missing
'#reset-cells' property in these controllers, e.g.:

arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7790-lager.dtb: Warning (resets_property): Missing property '#reset-cells' in node /clock-controller@e6150000 or bad phandle (referred from /can@e6e80000:resets[0])
arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7792-blanche.dtb: Warning (resets_property): Missing property '#reset-cells' in node /soc/clock-controller@e6150000 or bad phandle (referred from /soc/dma-controller@e6700000:resets[0])
arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7792-wheat.dtb: Warning (resets_property): Missing property '#reset-cells' in node /soc/clock-controller@e6150000 or bad phandle (referred from /soc/ethernet@e6800000:resets[0])
arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7793-gose.dtb: Warning (resets_property): Missing property '#reset-cells' in node /clock-controller@e6150000 or bad phandle (referred from /gpio@e6050000:resets[0])
arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7794-alt.dtb: Warning (resets_property): Missing property '#reset-cells' in node /clock-controller@e6150000 or bad phandle (referred from /i2c@e6500000:resets[0])
arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7794-silk.dtb: Warning (resets_property): Missing property '#reset-cells' in node /clock-controller@e6150000 or bad phandle (referred from /interrupt-controller@e61c0000:resets[0])

This adds it for the three r8a779x chips that were lacking it. The
binding mandates this as <1>, so this is the value I use.
