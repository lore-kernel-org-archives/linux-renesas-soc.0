No, there's no problem to solve. Firmware should enter deepest sleep
state in the system with SYSTEM_SUSPEND from which it can wakeup of course.

Cool.

This looks like custom file for me.
IIUC, the standard sysfs file for the system PM state is:
	/sys/power/state
1. s2ram:
	$ echo mem > /sys/power/state
2. s2idle
	$ echo freeze > /sys/power/state

As above

That should work.

This will work only if PSCI SYSTEM_SUPEND is implemented. If the SoC
can't wakeup if it's powered down, then it should not use that state
to implement SYSTEM_SUSPEND in PSCI firmware or just return the
SYSTEM_SUSPEND feature is not implemented in which case "freeze" is the
next available state to enter.

Just botching whatever shallow state you can enter on a particular SoC
into standard "mem" state sounds *horrible* to me.

That's perfect. I was worried that user-space is not doing that. So to
summarize, PSCI firmware either:
1. enters a sane and resumable state in SYSTEM_SUSPEND api
or
2. just don't implement SYSTEM_SYSTEM. Use the cpuidle+s2idle framework
   in Linux to enter the deepest idle state.

You literally need no extra work to enter this "freeze" state if the
CPU_SUSPEND in PSCI can enter the deepest idle state you want to enter
in this "s2idle" you are referring so far.
Just start with:

	$ cat /sys/power/state

and you should see "freeze" there, if not that's the first thing to
check provided the platform has cpuidle working.

Hope this helps.
