Actually on DT-based systems, the index is a driver-specific
implementation detail, and may differ from the actual reset specifier in DT.
E.g. on R-Car systems, DT uses a human-readable representation matching
the datasheet, while internally, the driver uses a packed representation.
Hence printing the index may confuse the user.

For lookup-based systems, this is different.

Scrap that: of_phandle_args is not derived from a device_node, so %pOFa
is not appropriate (and would crash instead of fall back to a pointer before
%pOFa support is implemented). And without more users, it doesn't make much
sense to go for a new type (e.g. "%pOA")...

Actually, printing the full reset specifier is not needed. A message like

    /soc/pwm@e6e31000 and /soc/pwm@e6e30000 share a reset on
/soc/clock-controller@e6150000

should give sufficient clue to the user.
