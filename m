Subject: [PATCH 0/4] iio: adc: Maxim max961x driver
Date: Fri, 24 Feb 2017 16:05:52 +0100

Hello!

This series adds driver and documentation for Maxim max9611/max9612
high-side current sense amplifier with 12-bit ADC and I2c interface.
It also registers two devices installed on VDD_0.8V and DVFS_0.8V lines
in Renesas r87796 Salvator-X board.

The device provides several functionalities, and only some of them are
currently supported by this driver.
Particularly, the on-board op-amp and analog comparator are not currently
supported.

A simplified integration schematic drawing is here reported:

 ----o----/\/\/-----o-------|LOAD|---
     |    shunt     |
 ____|______________|___
 |  RS+            RS-  |
 |   |-----gain-----|   |
 |          |           |
 |          |           |
 |max961x   |->| ADC |===== I2c
 |______________________|


The device provides though its 12-bits ADC the following informations:
- Common input voltage on RS+
- Voltage drop between RS+ and RS- ends
- Die temperature

All of the above ones are exposed though IIO with _raw and _scale values
(plus _input for milli degree Celsius die temperature).

>From the above values the driver calculates the current flowing between
RS+ and RS- ends, using the shunt resistor value provided by device tree, and
the power load. Again this values are exposed through _raw and _scale
attributes, which I'm not completely sure it's acceptables as they are
calculated values and not natively provided by the current sense amplifier.
I would like to hear IIO people opinions on this, if they should be better
exposed though some other attributes which are not _raw and _scale, or if
their calculation should be completely left to userspace tools.

Thanks
