Okay, I am fine with that. Please just check the other mail thread,
should we have a helper function that users call to set the flag?

I think we need to keep existing code in __device_suspend() as the
flag is used by drivers/ssb/pcihost_wrapper.c, from its ->suspend()
callback. Moreover, I think this is probably useful for other similar
scenarios of drivers dealing with parent devices.

However, adopting __device_suspend_late() to also deal the propagation
of the flag is a good idea.

Yes, that would be great!

Kind regards
