Hi Olof, Hi Kevin, Hi Arnd,

Please consider these second round of Renesas ARM based SoC DT updates for v4.10.

This pull request is based on a merge of:

* The previous round of such requests, tagged as renesas-dt-for-v4.10,
  which I have already sent a pull-request for.
* The rzg-clock-defs tag of Geert Uytterhoeven's renesas-driver's tree.
  This is to provide dependencies for adding the r8a7743 and r8a7745 SoCs.
* The "Second Round of Renesas ARM Based SoC Drivers Updates for v4.10",
  tagged as renesas-drivers2-for-v4.10, which I have also sent a pull
  request for. This is included to provide dependencies for adding device
  nodes for PRR, and adding the r8a7743 and r8a7745 SoCs..

  ARM: dts: r8a7794: Add device node for PRR (2016-11-17 15:07:49 +0100)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Second Round of Renesas ARM Based SoC DT Updates for v4.10

Enhancements:
* Add device nodes for PRR
* Add r8a7745 SoC and sk-rzg1e board
* Add r8a7743 SoC and sk-rzg1m board
* Enable SDR-104 and I2C demuxer on alt, koelsch and lager boards

Corrections:
* Use SYSC "always-on" PM Domain for sound on r8a7794 SoC
* Correct hsusb parent clock on r8a7794 SoC
* Correct PFC names for DU on alt board
