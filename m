I'd swear there's an "I" in port_names[], but upon checking again, it must
have been my eyes that mislead me. Sorry for that.
Hence please forget my comment above.

(Ah, the legacy and deprecated sysfs GPIO interface, being replaced
 by /dev/gpiochip[0-9]+ and https://github.com/brgl/libgpiod)

Cool, I didn't know that.
But you still need to know which number to write to the export file
in the first place?

You can add that later.  It doesn't add functionality, but may improve
performance for bitbanging multiple pins.
