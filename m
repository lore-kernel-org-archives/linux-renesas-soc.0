Subject: [PATCH v3 0/4] mmc: tmio: properly report status from autocmd12

New in V3:

* rebased to v4.11-rc2 and retested
* added one more tag from Simon

New in V2:
* Fix some more comments in patch 2.
* Add Simon's tags

SDHI automatically sends CMD12 when the desired amount of data was transferred
after multi block commands. However, the response from that CMD12 was never
reported back to the mmc core, so that errors like ECC might go unnoticed. This
series aims to fix that and clean up minor issues on the way when dealing with
the autocmd12 feature. Testing documentation can be found here [1] and thanks
must go to Shimoda-san for additional testing. Actually handling the ECC errors
in the core is a seperate issue and I'll post a patch for it right after this.

The patches are based on mmc-next as of today. A branch can be found here:

Thanks and all the best,

   Wolfram
