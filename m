The second CPU boots (irrespective of MD21 setting), but the kernel
starts spewing:

    clocksource: Switched to clocksource arch_sys_counter
    WARNING: Underflow in clocksource 'arch_sys_counter' observed,
time update ignored.
             Please report this, consider using a different
clocksource, if possible.
             Your kernel is probably still fine.
    WARNING: Underflow in clocksource 'arch_sys_counter' observed,
time update ignored.
             Please report this, consider using a different
clocksource, if possible.
             Your kernel is probably still fine.

Seems like the secondary CPU also needs CNTVOFF initialization,
which is done in the BSP in arch/arm/mach-shmobile/headsmp.S.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

                        Geert
