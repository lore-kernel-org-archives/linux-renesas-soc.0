OK, take Ethernet.  You need to configure WoL on that to wake up the system
in addition to setting power/wakeup for it.

Take WiFi: You need to set up WoW on that.

And so on.

That's right, but it will be very hard to convince me that changing the
meaning of the "wakeup" attribute just in order to work around this issue
(which arguably is a consequence of "unfortunate" hardware design) is a
good idea. :-)
