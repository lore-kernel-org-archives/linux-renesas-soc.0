Thanks for your investigation and heads up!

I think we should do the following:

* upstream the patches with no issues for v4.10 (Simon started this already)
* rebase the demux branch on top of the one you mentioned with the vin fixes
  and retest
* if all works in renesas-drivers, then just wait until vin patches are
  upstream and then we upstream the hdmi-demux-patches

And orthogonal to that:

* keep discussing what to do with DFVS (postponed to next week for me
  because of other duties)

Sounds good?

   Wolfram
