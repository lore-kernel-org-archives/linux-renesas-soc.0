No it shouldn't.

There are two cases to consider around this.

1) CONFIG_PM is unset. In this case pm_runtime_get_sync() will return
1, which is treated as succeeds by the error path.

2) CONFIG_PM is set, but the phy provider don't use runtime PM, thus
it hasn't called pm_runtime_enable() for its device. In this case,
pm_runtime_get_sync() returns -EACCES, which is also treated as
success by the error path.

Does it make sense?

Kind regards
Uffe
