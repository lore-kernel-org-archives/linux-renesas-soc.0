I'm not seeing a fix for this in linux-next, am I missing something?
Has anyone looked into it or is the issue still open?

Below is a tentative patch which moves PME polling to a freezable
workqueue, so it is frozen before the host bridge is suspended.
Geert, Laurent, could you test this?

The patch may be problematic in that pci_pme_list_scan() acquires
pci_pme_list_mutex, which is also acquired by pci_pme_active(),
which gets called when devices are suspended -- *after* the worker
has been frozen.  I'm not really familiar with the freezer, can it
happen that the worker is frozen while holding the mutex?  If so
this would deadlock.  Rafael?

Alternative approaches would be to
(a) skip devices in pci_pme_list_scan() if their is_prepared or
    is_suspended flags are set, or
(b) disable PME polling via a PM notifier.

The latter seems preferable performance-wise.  (To avoid checking
these flags once per second.)

Best regards,

Lukas
