Sorry, I'm no PCIe expert and the rcar HW documentation doesn't provide
enough detail. I guess (that's all I can do with this) the following:
a) the EP sends the PM_Enter_L1 DLLP,
b) the RP sends a PM_Request_Ack DLLP.
c) The EP physical layer is then inactive.
However, the rcar RP doesn't complete L1 transition, so the RP physical lay=
er
is still active. Hence the EP thinks it is in L1, but the RP is not.

rcar only supports D0 and D3, and L0/L0s/L1 so it's a bit simpler (I assume
devices can only be put into D states that are supported by the RP).=20
If I read the PCIe spec 5.3.2 correctly, for rcar, if the device is put int=
o D3,
the interconnect state must be L1. Hence my comment...

Re-reading Bjorn's comment, I believe he is discussing a different case.
I really don't know what will happen in this case.
Can you suggest a test to get a device to go from D3 to D0?
Would suspend using a NIC with WOL be enough? Or something simpler?

Sure, I'll help if I can.

Thanks for your help
