Subject: [RFC PATCH v2 0/2] mmc: core: process ECC errors raised in stop cmds
Date: Sat,  8 Apr 2017 22:20:04 +0200

Here is the second RFC for handling ECC errors flagged in the stop command
after a multiblock transfer. It is still RFC because I could only test it by
inducing ECC errors in software (see patch for TMIO below). Shimoda-san, can
you try this series with the SD tester again? That would be very kind.

Other than that, I hope the patch descriptions and comments explain the single
steps. Looking forward for thoughts.

Kind regards,

   Wolfram

Changes since RFC v1:

* rebased to mmc/next as of today
* reworded commit message for patch 1
* added tested-tag from Shimoda-san for patch 1
* added patch 2

Wolfram Sang (2):
  mmc: core: check also R1 response for stop commands
  mmc: core: for data errors, take response of stop cmd into account
