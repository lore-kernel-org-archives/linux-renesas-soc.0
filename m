Ah, sorry, I see now - it was taking a long time to page the 32-bit code
back in, and I'd forgotten the specifics of the mess of competing
"default domain" notions. Indeed, it's not the device's driver expecting
any state to be preserved as I got stuck on, it's the IOMMU driver,
which does "know better" to an extent, expecting its changes to the
struct device to stick for the lifetime of that structure.

I agree there shouldn't be a disparity - arch_setup_dma_ops() only does
things given certain circumstances, so arch_teardown_dma_ops() should
only undo them under the same. With probe-deferral in place I'll be
reviving my work to convert this path over to IOMMU API default domains,
which will make some of these issues go away again, but in the meantime
I also agree that the most expedient fix is indeed to add a flag to say
whether the dma ops were automatically set or not (this is implicitly
true on arm64, which was partly what was tripping me up).

Robin.
