Hi Bjorn, use devm_request_resource() for host bridge resource is cool,
what about do the similar change for x86, now we request host bridge resource
in pci_acpi_root_add_resources() in x86, and we would release the host bridge
resource when host bridge device refcount reach 0. This logic may introduce issue,
E.g.
If we try to remove a pci host bridge, but there is a child pci device which refcount
cannot decrease to 0 after remove the device, in this case, its parent pci_bus and
parent device, all their refcount cannot reach to 0, the result is pci host bridge
refcount can not reach 0, so its .release_fn() won't be called, and host bridge
resouces can not release. If we want to add the pci host bridge again, all pci devices
can not work because the resource is conflict with the old.

devm resource would be released when the driver detach, this is better than what we do now, I think.

Thanks!
Yijing.
