Thinking a bit more since I wrote my previous email.

It seems that the r8a77990 has a different feature set to other R-Car Gen3
SoCs but that the current driver implementation "renesas,rcar-gen3-iic"
and "renesas,rmobile-iic" do not exceed that feature set.

In future we could expand the features supported by the driver for other
Gen3 SoCs beyond what is supported for r8a77990. If we chose to describe
r8a77990 as compatible with renesas,rcar-gen3-iic then that implies those
new features would not be activated by matching on "renesas,rcar-gen3-iic",
though we could choose to control that using soc_match. Conversely if we
decide that r8a77990 is not compatible with renesas,rcar-gen3-iic then we
have more freedom to move with regards to adding features not supported by
r8a77990 to renesas,rcar-gen3-iic in future.

So perhaps it would be wise to be conservative and, for now,
not document r8a77990 as being compatible with renesas,iic-r8a77990.

I'm tempted to say that renesas,rmobile-iic is a lowest common denominator
and r8a77990 can be documented as being compatible with it. But we could
say the same of renesas,rcar-gen3-iic.

What do you think?
