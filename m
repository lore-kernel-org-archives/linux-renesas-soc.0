Actually we recently had a discussion about this on IRC, triggered by a
similar issue in board files (see e.g, Ethernet PHY interrupts).

Given the following comment:

drivers/of/irq.c:       /* Try the new-style interrupts-extended first */
drivers/of/irq.c:       res = of_parse_phandle_with_args(device,
"interrupts-extended",

I think it would be better to use interrupts-extended for individual/isolated
use outside the /soc node.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
