Hi Laurent, Geert,
    thanks for review

Actually Laurent's right and I have mis-interpreted the CHS signal purpose.

The CHS signal are not intended to select an external ADC where to 
sample from among the several connected ones, but instead to select 
which line to drive to a single ADC.

Quoting the processor manual, ADI supports three different ADC models 
through 3 different "modes"
- mode1: MB88101A
- mode2: ADCS7476/ADC121 and AD7476
- mode3: MAX1162
and cycles through channels moving the CHS[0:1] lines in mode1, and 
CHS[0:2] lines in mode2 and mode3.

Actually, being the MB88101A a 4-channel ADC, the CHS[0:1] lines could 
be connected to the ADC itself and used to cycle between its 4 input pins.
In mode2 and mode3 an external DEMUX is probably required, as the 
supported ADCs for these modes are single-channel ones.

For pin configuration purposes anyway, it's enough to know that we 
cannot split CHS signals in three separate groups, but in 2 only (one 
for mode1 and one for mode2 and 3).

Will send v2 shortly.
Thanks
