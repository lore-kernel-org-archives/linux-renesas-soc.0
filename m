Christoph, thanks for clear input.

Arnd, I think that given this discussion, best short-term solution is
indeed the patch I've submitted yesterday. That is, your version +
coherent mask support.  With that, set_dma_mask(DMA_BIT_MASK(64)) will
succeed and hardware with work with swiotlb.

Possible next step is to teach swiotlb to dynamically allocate bounce
buffers within entire arm64's ZONE_DMA.

Also there is some hope that R-Car *can* iommu-translate addresses that
PCIe module issues to system bus.  Although previous attempts to make
that working failed. Additional research is needed here.
