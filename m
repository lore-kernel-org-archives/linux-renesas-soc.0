Ok, good.

That seems reasonable, yes. We probably have to do both, as there are
cases where a device has dma_mask smaller than ZONE_DMA but the swiotlb
bounce area is low enough to work anyway.

Another workaround me might need is to limit amount of concurrent DMA
in the NVMe driver based on some platform quirk. The way that NVMe works,
it can have very large amounts of data that is concurrently mapped into
the device. SWIOTLB is one case where this currently fails, but another
example would be old PowerPC servers that have a 256MB window of virtual
I/O addresses per VM guest in their IOMMU. Those will likely fail the same
way that your does.

Does this IOMMU support remapping data within a virtual machine? I believe
there are some that only do one of the two -- either you can have guest
machines with DMA access to their low memory, or you can remap data on
the fly in the host.
