This is for CODEC<->CODEC links where no CPU DAI is involved and the
"CPU" side of the DAI link is actually a CODEC.

Ideally we'd make the DAI links agnostic to what is connected, e.g. it
shouldn't matter what type is connected to what side. But that does not
work since things are anti-symmetric between CPU and CODEC DAIs. On
CODEC DAIs the capture stream is output, on CPU DAIs the capture stream
is input, similar thing for playback. So we need to know whether the DAI
is a CPU DAI or a CODEC DAI.

Fixing this at this point is near to impossible since it requires
invasive changes to all existing drivers. So we need this code and can't
drop it.

The best we can do is try to come up with a generic interface that is
DAI type independent and recommend this interface for new drivers.
