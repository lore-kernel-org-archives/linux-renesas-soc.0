Thanks for the update!

i.e. will queue in clk-renesas-for-v4.20.

One possible area for improvement is removing the unused entries in the
module clocks part of the priv->clks[] array:

+       .num_hw_mod_clks = 11 * 32, /* includes STBCR0 which doesn't exist */

Due to having 8-bit instead of 32-bit registers, 11 * 24 entries are not used.
Fixing that means adding more checks in several functions, though, so I
don't know if you want to go that far...

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
