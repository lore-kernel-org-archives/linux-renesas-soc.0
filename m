This is basically talking about the "Port Input Buffer Control Register"
(PIBCn) which is actually not that important. But, you are also using it
for the special cases where you have to manually define the pin to be eithe=
r
input or output....but I would just remove INPUT_EN.

For the PIBCn register, just set it automatically if you are going to
use the pin as a GPIO (in or out). I have not really found a case yet where
I had to set this bit for another other than GPIO-input.

I would prefer to see a different define that talks about the pin being bi-=
directional
which is required for things like I2C, SDHI, etc... and would be directly r=
elated
to the "Port Bidirection Control Register" (PBDCn) for each pin.

#define BI_DIR		(1 << 3)


Additionally, according to the RZ/A1 hardware manual:
 "When the output buffer is enabled and the PBDCn.PBDCnm bit is 1, the
  input buffer is enabled regardless of this register setting."

For "software I/O" settings, you were using INPUT_EN to determine input or =
output.

To make things simple, I would just define:
#define SWIO_IN			(1 << 4)
#define SWIO_OUT			(1 << 5)


So in summary, this is how I think things should look in the DT:

Example of a 'normal' pin (most of the pins).
		/* P3_0 as TxD2; P3_2 as RxD2 */
		renesas,pins =3D <PIN(3, 0) 6>,
			       <PIN(3, 2) 4>;

Example of pins that need bi-directional specified:
		/* RIIC2: P1_4 as SCL, P1_5 as SDA */
		renesas,pins =3D <PIN(1, 4) (1 | BI_DIR)>,
			       <PIN(1, 5) (1 | BI_DIR)>;


Example of pins that need software I/O manually specified (because they are
whacky pins) as defined by Table 54.7:

		/* MTU2 TIOC0A as input capture */
		renesas,pins =3D <PIN(4, 0) (2 | SWIO_IN)>;

		/* MTU2 TIOC0A as output compare */
		renesas,pins =3D <PIN(4, 0) (2 | SWIO_OUT)>;

		/* LVDS */
		renesas,pins =3D <PIN(5, 0) (1 | SWIO_IN)>; /* the spec says to put these=
 as inputs */

		/* SSI Audio */
		renesas,pins =3D <PIN(2, 11) (4 | SWIO_OUT)>;

		/* Watchdog Overflow */
		renesas,pins =3D <PIN(3, 7) (8 | SWIO_OUT)>;
