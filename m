I tested this by updating the firmware on an H3 ES2.0 / Salvator-XS
using the instructions at
https://elinux.org/R-Car/Virtualization#Enabling_HYP_Support

I also fleshed out the opts table for the little CPUs using the following
from the 3.6.0 BSP:

With these changes in place CPUFreq seems to work for both BIG and little
CPUS. And the frequencies seem to be correct after S2RAM.

I am unable to take CPU0 offline.
