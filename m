The IOMMU probe-deferral patches queued for the current merge window get
rid of the need for early device creation bodges that cause the problem
(of IOMMU pagetables being mapped for DMA before dma-debug is up and
running). In the meantime, I'd suggest either adjusting the initcall
level per 256ff1cf6b44, or turning off the IOMMU driver and/or using
dma-debug's driver-filter option if you're doing more targeted debugging.
