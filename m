OK

That makes things a lot easier in principle. :-)

Well, this is what happens with the current code too.

I mean if unmodified genpd_finish_suspend() runs, it will call
pm_runtime_force_suspend() and that will check the device's runtime PM
status in the first place.  If that is "suspended", it will return
right away without doing anything (after disabling runtime PM, but
that is irrelevant here as runtime PM is already disabled).  In turn,
if the runtime PM status is "active", it will run
genpd_runtime_suspend() (as the callback) and that will run the
driver's runtime PM callback and the genpd_stop_dev() right after it.
Thus, if calling genpd_stop_dev() at that point is problematic, it is
problematic already today.

What the patch does is essentially to drop the driver's runtime PM
callback (should not be necessary) and the domain power off (certainly
not necessary) from that path, but to keep the genpd_stop_dev()
invocation that may be necessary in principle (the device is "active",
so genpd_runtime_suspend() has not run for it, so genpd_stop_dev() has
not been called for it yet, but it may be good to stop the clocks
before powering off the domain).

The resume part is basically running genpd_start_dev() for the devices
for which genpd_stop_dev() was run by genpd_finish_suspend(), which is
because the subsequent driver callbacks may expect the clocks to be
enabled.

I would like to treat it as a step away from what is there today,
retaining some of the existing functionality.

start/stop functionality, running genpd_stop_dev()/genpd_start_dev()

Right.

Drivers of the devices in the "stop/start" domains will have to use
pm_runtime_force_ suspend|resume() internally then to benefit from the
domain's management of clocks, but that just may be the only way to
avoid more problems.

Yes, it does.

I would say let's try to go with this patch of mine as submitted and
see how far we can get with that.

That essentially doesn't prevent us from dropping the
genpd_stop_dev()/genpd_start_dev() from the "noirq" stages if need be
after all, but dropping them right away may cause the fallout to be
more dramatic, at least in theory.

Thanks,
