PSCI does not know about the wake-up sources configured under Linux.

While SYSTEM_SUSPEND can wake up (e.g. from PMIC), it may not support all
wake-up sources configured from Linux. There's no API to communicate that
information (from Linux to PSCI), or to communicate that limitation (from
PSCI to Linux).

/sys/power/mem_sleep was added in v4.10-rc1, to choose which state to use
for s2ram, cfr. Documentation/power/states.txt.

As of v4.10-rc1, this will use either "s2idle", "shallow", or "deep" mode,
depending on availability and configuration through mem_sleep.
("deep" maps to PSCI SYSTEM_SUSPEND).

Correct.

I meant the "mem" one, which should not pick "deep" mode if it cannot wake-up
from that state using the configured wake-up sources.

The SoC can wake-up. It's just not guaranteed that it can wake-up using
the wakeup-source configured from Linux. Which wakeup-sources are available
depends on the actual PSCI implementation.  It's not specified by the PSCI
specification.

That's more or less what /sys/power/mem_sleep does, though.

In this case, it may resume using the PMIC only.
And there's no way for userspace (or even the kernel) to find out!
Hence my solution to:
  - add a DT property to indicate that PSCI will power down the SoC,
  - use "shallow" suspend if any Linux wakeup-sources have been configured
    and the property above is present.

In that case, it indeeds falls back to cpuidle/s2idle, which works fine.

"freeze" is always available.
"deep" is available if PSCI supports SYSTEM_SUSPEND.
My third patch adds "shallow", but it can be dropped (patch 4 can fall
through to cpu_do_idle() when needed, regardless of the existence of shallow).
