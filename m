Not correct: this Renesas platform does have PSCI system suspend.
So s2ram "works" (it suspends the system, which can be resumed by a switch)

PSCI system suspend does not support wake-up sources configured from Linux.
Hence I cannot use PSCI system suspend if any wake-up sources have been
configured from Linux, and I expect to be able to use them for wake-up.

I did explain, cfr.:
  1. The power consumption figures in the cover letter:
      - shallow:    8.4 W   6.2 W   (secondary CPU cores off)
  2. The description for patch 3/6:
        As secondary CPU cores are taken offline, "shallow" suspend mode saves
        slightly more power than "s2idle", but less than "deep" suspend mode.
        However, unlike "deep" suspend mode, "shallow" suspend mode can be used
        regardless of the presence of support for PSCI_SYSTEM_SUSPEND, which is
        an optional API in PSCI v1.0.

So, how does the communication of wake-up sources happens between PSCI
and Linux?

Perhaps, I didn't make myself clear. Let's summarize:
  1. On Renesas R-Car Gen3 platforms, PSCI SYSTEM_SUSPEND is implemented,
  2. On these platforms, PSCI SYSTEM_SUSPEND powers down the SoC, and supports
     wake-up from PMIC only,
  3. If the user wants to use a different wake-up source, these other
wake-up sources fail
     to wake up the system from PSCI SYSTEM_SUSPEND.,
  4. Patch 3/6 adds a new "shallow" state, as it allows to save more
power (the difference
     may be due to suboptimal cpuidle platform support on R-Car Gen3, though),
  5. Patch 4/6 makes the system use the new "shallow" state iff
       a. the user has configured other wake-up sources, and
       b. DT advertises that PSCI will power down the SoC on SYSTEM_SUSPEND,
     hence other wake-up sources now work as expected.

(If you're so against implementing the "shallow" state, it's a red herring,
 and that patch can be dropped.  Patch 4/6 can be trivially modified, as
 all it does is call cpu_do_idle() instead).

E.g. on non-PSCI platforms with an Ethernet driver that supports
Wake-on-LAN, I can do:

        ethtool -s eth0 wol g
        echo mem > /sys/power/state

and be sure that the system can be woken up by sending a WoL MagicPacket.

On PSCI systems, the above may work, or may not work. And there's no way to
find out (in an automated way) whether it will work or not.

If it doesn't work, the user has to configure his system (manually) to
not use "mem" state.
Since v4.10-rc1, that can be done using e.g.

    echo s2idle > /sys/power/mem_sleep

and my patches make that automatic (for a new "shallow" state instead
of "s2idle", though).

So all of this is a usability issue, and a nightmare for userspace
that wants to treat
different platforms in a generic way (e.g. for distros).

I hope this time it's clear what I want to achieve, and how.

Thanks!
