Subject: [PATCH v6 00/12] ARM/arm64: dts: rcar: Add SYSC PM domains

	Hi Simon, Magnus,

This patch series adds the R-Car System Controller to the DTS files for
the various Renesas R-Car SoCs, and hooks up devices to their respective
PM domains.

This (more specifically patch 1) is a dependency for the enablement of the
Display Unit on R-Car H3, as on this SoC the DU needs to use the VSPs, and the
VSPs are located in a PM Domain.

This series contains 2 parts, for both arm64 and arm32:
  1. Patches 1 (arm64) and 3-7 (arm32) add device node for the System
     Controllers, and hook up CPU cores and L2 caches/SCUs to their
     respective PM Domains,
  2. Patches 2 (arm64) and 8-12 (arm32) hook up devices to the SYSC
     "always-on" PM Domain, for a more consistent device-power-area
     description in DT.

Changes compared to v5:
  - Add Acked-by,
  - Rebased R-Car Gen2 patches because of dropping of references to the
    second DMA controllers,
  - Updated for addition of sdhi[0-2] device nodes on r8a7793,
  - Reordered arm64 patches first, as these have a higher priority.

Changes compared to v4:
  - Add Acked-by,
  - Remove "power-domains" property again from the sysc nodes, as the
    System Controller theirselves are not part of the Clock Domains.

Changes compared to v3:
  - Add power-domains properties to the sysc nodes, to refer to the
    SoC's Clock Domains,
  - Extract using the SYSC "always-on" PM Domain on R-Car H3 into its
    own patch,
  - Add patches to use the SYSC "always-on" PM Domain on R-Car H1 and
    R-Car Gen2,
  - Update for recently added can0, can1, pciec0, and pciec1 device
    nodes on R-Car H3.

Changes compared to v2:
  - Move power area hierarchy from DT to C (cfr. DT bindings for Renesas
    CPG/MSSR), and switch to "#power-domain-cells = <1>",
  - Drop fallback compatibility strings, as the bindings are
    SoC-specific,
  - Add an "always-on" power area on R-Car H3.

Changes compared to v1:
  - Add R-Car H3 (r8a7795) support,
  - Use "renesas,<type>-sysc" instead of "renesas,sysc-<type>",
  - Add fallback compatibility strings for R-Car Gen2 and Gen3.

Dependencies:
  - renesas-devel-20160422v2-v4.6-rc4.

Suggested patch application strategy:
  - On branch arm64-dt-for-v4.7:
      - Merge rcar-sysc-for-v4.7,
      - Apply patches 1-2.
  - On branch dt-for-v4.7:
      - Merge rcar-sysc-for-v4.7,
      - Apply patches 3-12.

Suggested arm-soc pull request strategy:
  - Send pull-request for rcar-sysc-for-v4.7,
  - Send pull-request for arm64-dt-for-v4.7,
  - Send pull-request for dt-for-v4.7.

For your convenience, I've pushed this to the topic/rcar-sysc-pd-dt-v6
branch of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/geert/renesas-drivers.git.
Integration with renesas-drivers-2016-04-12-v4.6-rc3 is available in the
topic/gen3-latest branch.

This has been tested on r8a7779/marzen, r8a7790/lager, r8a7791/koelsch,
r8a7794/alt, and r8a7795/salvator-x.

Thanks for applying!

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
