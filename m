That is actually mentioned in the paragraph above:

- clocks: Most controllers only have 1 clock source per channel. However, on
          some variations of this controller, the internal card detection
          logic that exists in this controller is sectioned off to be run by a
          separate second clock source to allow the main core clock to be turned
          off to save power.

so I suggest just integrating the (short) list in that paragraph.

Bogus trailing double quote.
