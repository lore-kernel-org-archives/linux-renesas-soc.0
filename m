Dropping 10-bit support would be super nice from a maintenance point of
view, but I didn't have hopes for that to happen ;) This is why I wanted
to buy a device to be able to test.

Yeah, good idea to scan for I2C_CLIENT_TEN directly. From a glimpse, I
didn't see a device which I could easily buy, connect, and sniff the
wires. But it is not urgent anyhow.

Agreed. It will stay, I had no intention of removing it.

Thanks for the help!
