This series adds r8a7796 (R-Car M3-W), r8a77970 (R-Car V3M) and
r8a77995 (R-Car D3) support to the IPMMU driver.

The maximum number of micro-TLBs are increased and the driver is adjusted
to match on the new DT bindings posted separately.

Changes since V4:
 - Marked as RFC as I believe more consideration of driver support
   for these SoCs is required
 - Moved DT bindings documentation into separate patch-set
   "[PATCH 0/2] iommu/ipmmu-vmsa: Add r8a779(6|70|95) DT bindings"
   as I believe these are ready to be merged
 - Rebased
 - Collected driver updates for r8a7796, and r8a77970 and r8a77995 SoCs
   into a single patchset.

Changes since V3:
 - Rebased on top of [PATCH v4 00/09] iommu/ipmmu-vmsa: r8a7795 support V4
 - Patch 3/3 updated with Reviewed-by - thanks Geert!

Changes since V2:
 - Patch 2/3 updated with an outer set of () - thanks Ramesh!
 - Patch 2/3 updated with Reviewed-by - thanks Geert!
 - Patch 3/3 updated to include white list support

Changes since V1:
 - Patch 1/3 updated with more Acked-by tags
 - Patch 2/3 updated with high I/O register range support
