Adding a workaround for them kind of encourages new code to do the same
thing, which actually may really hurt.  So I assume that these call sites are
all legacy and that's why you don't want to touch them for now, but in that
case the commit message should make it very clear that this is about legacy
only and new code should not call device_set_wakeup_enable() during suspend.

[Something should be printed to the log if wakeup source objects
are created while system suspend is in progress I guess or similar.]

Honestly, this sounds like "We have this change we really really would like to
make, but there's incorrect code getting in the way, so let's paper over it
and be done."  Not very nice. :-/

How many drivers actually do call device_set_wakeup_enable() during suspend?

Thanks,
Rafael
