In drivers/dma/sh/rcar-dmac.c, I would try to replace the below line:
SET_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS(rcar_dmac_sleep_suspend, rcar_dmac_sleep_resume)

with:
SET_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS(pm_runtime_force_suspend, pm_runtime_force_resume)

in case that may be too early to suspend the dma device (which is
rather common for dma devices) then try;

SET_LATE_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS(pm_runtime_force_suspend, pm_runtime_force_resume)

Kind regards
Uffe
