You're right. While Magnus did send out a patch that added the check for both,
in the end a newer revision touching r8a7791 only was applied.
Whether r8a7790 is really not affected is not clear to me...

That's interesting. So there may be different firmware/boot loader on Koelsch
and Porter.

Or perhaps it's just random: on Koelsch, I only had the issue after a Real Cold
Boot (in the morning). During the day, it used to work with MD21=1, too.

Now, we're getting closer to the moment Simon will close his tree for v4.8.
Can we apply my series as-is, or do we need the DBGRCR handling first,
probably postponing all of this to v4.9?

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
