If this is OK for you, I'd like to include the first 3 patches (plus a small
fix I received offline from Chris Brandt[*]) in my final pull request of
sh-pfc for v4.13 (which I have been postponing in anticipation of this driver).

After v4.13-rc1, Simon can queue up the DTS patches in his tree for v4.14.

Thanks!
