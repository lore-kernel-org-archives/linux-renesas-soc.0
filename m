Thanks for your patch!

On RZ/A1, the datasheet called this "Ports", and the corresponding compatible
value is "renesas,r7s72100-ports".
On RZ/A2, the datasheet calls this "GPIO", so perhaps "renesas,r7s9210-gpio"?
Hmm, then you may want to call the single node gpio-controller instead of
pin-controller (and all references to it)? It's really both.

On RZ/A1, it's different, as you have a single pin-controller node, with GPIO
subnodes.

0x9d1

BTW, that's a real odd number. What about rounding up to the hardware
granularity, i.e. 0x1000?

This may conflict with MIPS again ;-)
Oh, you don't include the bindings header in the driver source file, and doing
so would cause issues with (previous version of) the enum...

Still, would it make sense to call these PORTx instead of Px?
The register descriptions use PORTx.<reg>.

There's no PM in my datasheet. Should that be JP0?
Oh, the register descriptions do use PORTM.

These are not really the upper 8 bits, unless your wordsize is 24-bit ;-)

"upper 16 bits", like on RZ/A1?
