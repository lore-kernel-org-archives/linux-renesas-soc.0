There's an (old) version of an r8a7791 CPG/MSSR driver at
https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/geert/renesas-drivers.git/log/?h=topic/cpg-mssr-v4

To handle it cleanly, this is going to need "[PATCH/RFC v3 00/22] soc:
renesas: Add R-Car RST driver for obtaining mode pin state"...

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
