Renesas ARM SoCs already implement (parts of) that.

There are separate sets of the Module SToP register bits for each set of
CPUs. Only if all sets agree the clock supply to a module will be stopped,
which can be monitored using the status Registers.
So for the CAN modules itself there is no issue, as the clock supply to the
modules will not be stopped as long as the RT CPU keeps it enabled.
There must be more to it (secure mode?), as some R-Car Gen3 module clocks
cannot seem to be disabled by disabling them for all documented CPU sets.

There's also a global bit to prevent modifying any clock register.
This could be used to prevent changing the CAN parent clock (changing
its divider and/or stopping it). However, as this is a global bit, it would
affect the full Linux clock driver.

Again, probably there's more to it when using secure mode...
