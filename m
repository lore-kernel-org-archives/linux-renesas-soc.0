Oh, I just received the list of pin in txt format iirc and didn't
noted down which peripherals where actually bi-dir

That was mode #3, sorry about this.

Correct

Looking at RZ/A1H tables you're right. I wonder why in RZ/A1L SSI pins
are listed as bidir and in RZ/A1H they're not.

And I keep counting modes from 0...

So it's fine to leave TIOC out from this table.

Can confirm TIOC pins are not listed in SWIO table in RZ/A1H.

Thanks for double checking. Your source from Japan is more
authoritative than manuals and defintely more accurate than me ;)
