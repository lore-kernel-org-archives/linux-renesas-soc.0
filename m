I think we discussed this earlier. The problem with these devices is
that it covers several type of devices, so it's hard to find a generic
node name.

The devices are: MMC, eMMC, SD, SDIO. I don't have strong opinions on
whether to chose a generic node name, and perhaps "mmc" is the best we
can get?

Whatever we decide, we should update all mmc DTS docs, to avoid future
confusion.

Kind regards
