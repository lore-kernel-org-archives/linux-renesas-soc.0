Yes, this should be a separate patch.

I got it. However, I have a concern how to set the mode to peripheral on RZ=
/A2
if we applied this code. If someone would like to use the USB as peripheral
on his board, this code is not suitable.

So, I have an idea to set the default mode by using "dr_mode" property,
instead of hardcoded. Since the driver already has such a function,
we can reuse rcar_gen3_device_recognition() to set the default value.
To achieve that, we need to modify the following though.
 - Don't enable "is_otg_channel".
 - Don't call rcar_gen3_enable_vbus_ctrl() to avoid ADPCTRL register
   because RZ/A2 doesn't have it.
 - Don't need to call rcar_gen3_set_linectrl to avoid LINECTRL1 register
   because RZ/A2 doesn't seem to need the setting on host mode.

What do you think?

I guess we need to modify ./drivers/usb/renesas_usbhs/rza.c for RZ/A2
because RZ/A2's HS-USB has SYSCFG.CNEN, but doesn't have SYSCFG.UPLLE?

I got it. So, I guess someone wants to use 1 host and 1 peripheral :)
