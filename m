We definitely considered that option.
However, we concluded that in the end, we want to mainly support production
SoCs.  Hence the default files should represent the production version.
Using a preproduction SoC can be considered a special case, and thus needs
a file with a special esX ID in its name.

We do realize this can cause some inconveniences during the transition period,
when most developers don't have access to ES2.0 SoCs yet, or have mixed
environments of ES1.x and ES2.0.

Of course you can keep on using the current DTB (binary) on your H3 ES1.x
boards, as long as you don't need to use devices not yet described in that DTB.

Thanks!
