So here's what I found.

According to:

https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/dmaengine/client.txt

It says:
"Note that callbacks will always be invoked from the DMA engines=20
tasklet, never from interrupt context."


My DMA driver was calling the SDHI callback from within a tasklet (ie,=20
softirq). Almost all the other DMA drivers doing the same thing.

All was fine until that patch you submitted (52ad9a8e854c) that now adds
a wait_for_completion() in the SDHI callback.

Now I get the "BUG: scheduling while atomic".

The R-Car driver uses a threaded irq to call the callbacks, not a=20
tasklet.

So I hacked my code to also call the callbacks from a threaded irq like=20
rcar-dma.c.
And....that works (no more scheduling while atomic).

So, the question is, which of these statements are correct?

  1. wait_for_completion should not be called in a DMA callback

  2. DMA engine drivers should use threaded IRQs instead of tasklets


The issue with #2 is that mic_x100_dma.c, sh/rcar-dmac.c and=20
sh/shdma-base.c are the only ones calling request_threaded_irq,
so you would think that tasklets are the correct method.


Thanks,
Chris
