Sorry, I misread you, I thought that H3 named the group mdio (you might want 
to clarify this in the commit message). I was referring to when M3 PFC support 
was introduced, which was v4.10, so that's just two releases. We obviously 
can't rename mdc to mdio on H3 if we want to keep backward compatibility.
