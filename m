Ok, got it. I have to admit that most of my knowledge about the internals
of IOMMUs is from PowerPC of a few years ago, which couldn't do this at
all. I agree that we need to do the same thing on swiotlb and iommu then.

Can you describe this a little more? We should at least try to not
make it harder to solve the next problem while solving this one,
so I'd like to understand the exact limitation you are hitting there.
