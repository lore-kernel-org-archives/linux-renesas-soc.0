I replaced the calls to rcu_irq_{enter,exit}() in irq_{enter,exit}() by their
_irqson counterparts, which should be equivalent to the old code, but the issue
persisted. Strange...

Does it matter that arm has
#define __ARCH_IRQ_EXIT_IRQS_DISABLED   1
?

I tried JTAG, but enabling JTAG on r8a7791/koelsch requires changing a switch
on the board, which also disables the second CPU core, and thus makes the issue
disappear...

Possible. I tried adding 'if(!irqs_disabled) printk("something")' just before
the RCU_LOCKDEP_WARN(), but it never triggered. Worse, the issue went away by
doing that :-(
