Thanks for your patches!
They look good to me, hence my Reviewed-by.

While your new WAKEUP_POWERED definitely serves a purpose, I don't think
it's the right solution for the Renesas SoCs.  I can just set the recently
added flag GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP in all Renesas clock/power domain
drivers to fix the issue for all Renesas drivers.  After all, all devices in
the clock/power domain must be kept enabled if they're a wakeup source, or
part of the wakeup path.

Not using GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP means I would have to add the
WAKEUP_POWERED flag to every single driver that can either be a wakeup
source itself, or be part of the wakeup path.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

                        Geert
