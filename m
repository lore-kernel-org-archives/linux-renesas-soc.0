Thank you for double-checking. I agree with your analysis.

To make a difference, we would need an IOMMU driver that creates a mapping 
after a first round of arch_setup_dma_ops() / arch_teardown_dma_ops() calls, 
follow by a second round. I don't think this could happen, but if it did, I 
believe we'd be screwed already, as there would be a time were an incorrect 
mapping (created by arch_setup_dma_ops() while the IOMMU driver needs to take 
care of mapping creation) exists.

Yes I think it should. Could you please take care of that ?

You can also add my

Tested-by: Laurent Pinchart <laurent.pinchart@ideasonboard.com>

as I've tested that this paptch restores proper IOMMU operation on the Renesas 
R-Car H2 Lager board. I believe the problem related to Sricharan's patch 
reported by Geert still affects us and needs to be addressed separately.
