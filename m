Subject: [PATCH v2 00/23] ARM/arm64: dts: renesas: Fix W=1 dtc warnings

	Hi Simon, Magnus, Morimoto-san, Rob,

This patch series fixes the new warnings related to Renesas arm32/arm64
DTSes that can be seen in -next using "make W=1 dtbs", courtesy of
commit b993734718c01064 ("scripts/dtc: Update to upstream version
53bf130b1cdd") in Rob herring's for-next branch. For testing, you can just
cherry-pick that commit (showing the warning for W=1 only was a separate
commit).

All warnings were of the form:

    Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): Node /cache-controller@0 has a unit name, but no reg property
    Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): Node /cache-controller has a reg or ranges property, but no unit name
    Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): Node /clocks@e0110000/iic0_sclkdiv has a reg or ranges property, but no unit name
    Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): Node /i2c@2 has a unit name, but no reg property
    Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): Node /keyboard/button@1 has a unit name, but no reg property
    Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): Node /memory has a reg or ranges property, but no unit name
    Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): Node /pfc@e0140200/serial@e1030000 has a unit name, but no reg property
    Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): Node /regulator@0 has a unit name, but no reg property
    Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): Node /sound@ec500000/rcar_sound,ctu/ctu@0 has a unit name, but no reg property
    Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): Node /sound@ec500000/rcar_sound,dvc/dvc@0 has a unit name, but no reg property
    Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): Node /sound@ec500000/rcar_sound,mix/mix@0 has a unit name, but no reg property
    Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): Node /sound@ec500000/rcar_sound,src/src@0 has a unit name, but no reg property
    Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): Node /sound@ec500000/rcar_sound,ssi/ssi@0 has a unit name, but no reg property

Fixes:
  - For cache-controllers of Cortex A7, A15, A53, and A57, I moved them
    inside the /cpus node, and made their unit names and reg properties
    match the MPIDR values,
  - For clocks, I added the missing unit names,
  - For regulators, i2c-gpios buses, and sound nodes, I (more-or-less)
    replaced the '@' by a dash,
  - For buttons, I changed the node name to match the key events,
  - For pinctrl, I changed the node name to the device name.

Note that to get rid of all warnings for the /memory node,
arch/arm/boot/dts/skeleton.dtsi should be fixed, too.

Changes compared to v1:
  - Add missing 0x-prefix to non-zero cache-controller reg properties,
  - Change regulator names from fixedregulator3v3 to regulator-3v3.

Morimoto-san: If this is accepted, the examples in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sound/renesas,rsnd.txt should be
updated, too.

Boot-tested on r8a73a4/ape6evm, r8a7740/armadillo, r8a7791/koelsch,
sh73a0/kzm9g, r8a7795/salvator-x. I didn't test sound, but the kernel
log didn't show any failures.

The patches are against renesas-devel-20160509-v4.6-rc7.

Thanks for your comments!
