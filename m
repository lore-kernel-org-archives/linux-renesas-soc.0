Ping ?

I'd like to standardize on one model for panel DT bindings, but I'm not sure 
that can be achieved given that we already have multiple competing models. In 
any case, is that blocking to merge this patch ? I only describe one 
connectivity model here as that's what my panel driver needs, but I have no 
issue adding more models later when needed. I believe this patch is a good 
step forward already.
