They are not all the same, but the locations are not split according to
the platform names either. The early realview platforms are like versatile
here, while later realview platforms have the alias plus more, and vexpress
has it in two other places depending on the generation.

I misremembered vexpress and thought that it was like the later
realview, but at least versatile and realview are basically the same
thing (the story with NOR flash is similar).

I have not yet seen any argument why that is an important distinction, i.e.
what is the downside of letting users just turn the MMU and XIP options
on and off without changing everything else, other than this having been
the default in the past?

Obviously you won't be able to boot on machines when configured for
a different physical address (for RAM, flash or uart), but even that is
no change from what we have on the NOMMU platforms: on any of them
you have to manually type the address when configuring your kernel
for a given target and change it again when you want to run on another
board that doesn't share the exact address.
