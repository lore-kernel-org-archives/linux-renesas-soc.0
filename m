How do you use other wake-up sources, like wake on LAN, UART or GPIO?

Good to hear this is not limited to Renesas platforms, so there's a common
problem to solve.

If this is true for all PSCI platforms, there's indeed no need for such a
property, and drivers/firmware/psci.c should default to this case.

Yes, cfr. "s2idle" above.
The user can specify to use "s2idle" manually:

    $ echo s2idle > /sys/power/mem_sleep # or "shallow"

However, how to handle this automatically, e.g. by a distro?
On most other platforms, userspace can just do e.g.

    ethtool -s eth0 wol g

to enable wake-on-LAN, and suspend to the deepest supported state using:

    echo mem > /sys/power/state

On systems where PSCI SYSTEM_SUSPEND powers down the SoC, userspace must
make sure to configure to use "s2idle" (or "shallow) instead, else the
configured wake-up sources won't work.
I want Linux to handle this automatically.
