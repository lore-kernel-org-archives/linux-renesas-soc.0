That's what I expected...

Good, so we know which module clocks are enabled/disabled...

The above disabled all unused MSTP clocks...

... after which only the 3 above are still enabled.

The sdhi0 MSTP clock is now enabled (and never disabled later)...

... still it failed.

As the sdhi0 MSTP clock is still enabled, there must be an unknown clock that's
needed for proper operation, but that's currently not controlled by software.

With topic/renesas-debug, you can enable/disable module clocks from the
shell, e.g.

              echo sdhi0=on > /proc/mstp
              echo sdhi0=0 > /proc/mstp
              echo 314=off > /proc/mstp

or control which clocks are disabled at boot time by modifying the
SMSTPx_DISABLE macros.
