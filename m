Yes. But what do you want to control if it's not enabled at all?

To my understanding, as long as we don't enable the CA53 cores, we don't 
enable their L2 caches, too. And then we don't have to PM control them?

Yes, this is understood :)

Your argument is the Spec/ePAPR, my point of view is the practical 
implementation. I'd think both are valid. Therefore let's see what 
Sudeep thinks ;)
