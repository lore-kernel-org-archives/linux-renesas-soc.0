I was looking into this in some more detail.

As you are stating that Ethernet device is a child device to the local
bus device, I would have expected that the pm_runtime_get_sync()
invoked during ->probe() in the Ethernet driver should cause its
parent device (the bus device) to be "forced" resumed.

That's because the pm_runtime_get_sync() should trigger an increased
usage count of the parent device. Later, when
pm_runtime_force_resume() validates the count for the bus device, it
should be 2 and thus it should lead to that it decides to *not* defer
the resume of the device. Apparently this isn't happening for some
reason...

Perhaps there's a pm_suspend_ignore_children() set for the parent?
Or perhaps the parent/child relationship isn't set up correctly?

Thanks for the detailed explanation of what is happening!

Unless we can fix this in the Ethernet driver/local bus, I have some
ideas of how we could change genpd, to still allow $subject patch to
be applied. Although I will wait a day or two before I propose
something. In the meantime I will also try to collect some more
information.

Thanks!

Kind regards
Uffe
