I prefer a separate fixes branch. It's fine for all other branches
to be based on top of this branch so you have a working baseline
for testing.

I'd say don't wait longer than a week before forwarding bugfixes.
If you find something urgent, just send that right away along with
whatever less urgent patches you have accumulated.

It's possible we won't merge it right away as we might all be busy
for a couple of days, but in the worst case that means you send
another fixes pull request that is a superset before we have merged
the first one.
