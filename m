    I understand. I was just surprised by what checking the code against the 
schematics revealed.

    I should've CC'ed Phil myself...

    Let's hope he'd reply...

    Yes, of course. I don't remember the gory details already -- I might have 
blindly copied what was in the Koelsch's .dts.

    I know the PCIe driver does require this clock in order to function -- it 
would be the same eternal -EPROBE_DEFER condition you'd already described;
see drivers/pci/host/pcie-rcar.c yourself...

    Zero frequency is hardly any better then the default...

    It's not that odd given that the R-Car gen2 manual specifically says it 
should be 48 MHz.
    Looking into the manual again, the PCIe bus clock must be the onne 
presented on the CICREF[PN]1_SATA/PCIe input signals and it indeed should be 
100 MHz... So Phil was correct.
