OK, I first I didn't understand what you are referring here but I see
some reference further in the email.

No, they were just examples of idle states that CPU_SUSPEND call might
support based on what h/w can support on a particular platform.

CPU_SUSPEND with different parameters, just look at the details on
suspend parameters in Section 5.4.2 CPU_SUSPEND parameters: power_state

Yes, the above section should provide some insight on the same.

Agreed.

Yes it's better to check. I am afraid that both these states will be
same if PSCI implementation is correct and hence we don't want to
support standby suspend mode.

Yes that's what I suspect and hence I said it's incomplete
implementation of CPU_SUSPEND

Yes that's true form any thing other than "deep" state. i.e. s2idle or
standby. If you are OK to choose standby why not s2idle ?

I understand your intentions and but I have NACKed it with sufficient
reasoning. I don't want to repeat them again here.

So, all these hacks are just to cope up with that ? Sorry that's
non-sense. Working around a firmware bug is different from working
around the incomplete firmware implementation. We may consider former
but for me latter is just insane.
