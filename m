The "No sensors found" message is from the "sensors" application.
The device type associated with the passed device is unknown to
libsensors (it is parsed from the parent device subsystem name -
what is that, anyway ?). This could be addressed in libsensors,
or the thermal subsystem could attach itself to a known subsystem,
or the thermal subsystem must pass a pointer the parent device.

Again, trying to address the problem in the hwmon core is simply wrong.
