Subject: [PATCH 0/2] gen3: dts: enable on-board eMMC
Date: Wed, 14 Sep 2016 19:09:41 +0200

Here are the DTS changes to enable the on-board eMMC memory at 8 bit bus
widths on R-Car Gen3 Salvator-X boards.

Note that 'non-removable' is not supported yet because of Runtime PM issues. It
seems we need to overhaul Runtime PM handling for other reasons as well, so I
suggest the basic support goes in like this and DTS do not use 'non-removable'
for now.

Note also that I decided to use the pattern that pinctrl-0 is 3.3v and
pinctrl-1 is 1.8v, although the eMMC is fixed at 1.8v. I tried a few ways to
only use pinctrl-0 being 1.8v here, but they all ended up to be confusing for
users IMO, so I sticked to the most consistent solution after all.

These patches are based on top of Simon's sdr104-v7 patches and the accompanied
driver patches sent a minute ago. A branch can be found here:
