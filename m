OK, but I don't see any issue with that. That's exactly how it works on
ARM Juno platform. The SoC is powered down.

NACK, you don't need any such properties.

Have you explored suspend-to-idle instead ? It looks like thats exactly
what you are doing in this patch set. You also get low latency for free
as it just enters the deepest idle state on all CPUs instead of
hotplugging out all the secondaries.
