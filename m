Koelsch/Lager and Porter. The U-Boot is newer than the one on Lager,
though, so no need for the "dtb" keyword in the bootz command.

I use:

    setenv ethaddr 2e:01:02:03:04:05
    tftp 41000000 porter/zImage
    tftp 40f00000 porter/r8a7791-porter.dtb
    bootz 41000000 - 40f00000

Perhaps you didn't have the MAC address set?

BTW, for blanche, I had to add "setenv fdt_high 41000000".

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
