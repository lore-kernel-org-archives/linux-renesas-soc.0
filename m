Try e.g. adding a client device with some address to the root i2c
adapter, and then add another client device with the same address
to one of the mux child adapters. Do that with and without your
patch. I suspect it will be allowed with your patch even though it
shouldn't.

Well, you can use the method from i2c_parent_is_i2c_adapter() and
write a function like so (untested):

struct i2c_adapter *i2c_is_i2c_adapter(struct device *dev)
{
	if (dev->type != &i2c_adapter_type)
		return NULL;

	return to_i2c_adapter(dev);
}

But why do you need to identify them? What problem are you trying to solve?

Also, I forgot to mention this in my first reply, but note that the
device implementing the i2c-mux need not be a child of the i2c adapter.
I.e. in your example, the device I'm talking about is gmsl-deserializer@0.
This "MUX" device could be e.g. a platform device situated in some other
completely random place in the device tree. Oh well, perhaps not random,
but I hope you get what I mean...
