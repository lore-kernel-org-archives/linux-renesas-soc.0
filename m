Exactly.

It's debatable: from one side, it's good to reuse code. From the other other,
to much conditional logic complicates everything.

The reset controller part will be different anyway.
But the clock domain part and most of the core/module logic is the same.
Perhaps some common code can be spun off?

At least in DTS and the module clock table, you can get that with cpg-mssr, too,
if you use a different macro.

IC. When CPG/MSSR was introduced, we had ordering issues on R-Car, too.
