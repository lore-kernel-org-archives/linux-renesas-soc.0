Well, I'm not convinced that this is the right approach, though.

That doesn't really matter.  "enabled" in "wakeup" only means that user space
allows the device to wake up the system from sleep, but it still may not be
able to do that for certain reasons (like in this case).  By adding this
callback you're changing the meaning of the attribute.

Yes, I do.
