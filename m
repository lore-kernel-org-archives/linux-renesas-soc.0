The other way around. The user must not flip the switch before the PMIC
is configured for DDR backup mode, else the system will be powered off
immediately.

  1. User writes to wakeup, which invokes the new callback, and configures
       the PMIC for DDR backup mode,
  2. User flips the switch,
  3. User writes to /sys/power/state to suspend.

After system suspend:
  4. User flips the switch to resume.

Yes, it is convoluted. I hope I managed to explain it clearly this time.

Currently step 1 is done using i2set from userspace, which is very unfriendly
(cfr. https://elinux.org/R-Car/Boards/Salvator-XS#PSCI_System_Suspend).

Note that on systems with a momentary power switch (e.g. R-Car Starter Kit Pro
or Premier aka [HM]3ULCB), step 2 is not needed.
Hence things are simplified a lot, as PMIC configuration can be done from
the PMIC's suspend callback on these platforms.
