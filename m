Matching on the SoC-specific compat strings is not sufficient, as the actual
TMU instances in the same SoC are not identical.

Please check Section 80.1.1 "Features".

The differences are in the number of clock inputs. As these are not the plain
clocks, but core clocks + a postdivider, perhaps this can be handled by using
clock-names like "div4", "div16", "div64" etc.?
I haven't checked the relation to register bits yet.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
