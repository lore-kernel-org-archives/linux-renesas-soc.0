So you need a flag and a status bit.

The flag says what the driver wants (and what it wants for a
particular device) and the status bit reflects the current situation
(taking dependencies into account).

Say a device has two children, A and B, and both of them have the new flag set.

If either A or B is configured for system wakeup, power should not be
removed from the parent.  However, if neither A nor B is configured
for system wakeup, power can be removed from the parent on suspend
unless the parent driver itself has set the new flag.
Thus setting the new flag by the child drivers alone doesn't imply the
specific handling of the parent unless additional conditions occur.

That can be represented by a status bit that will be set or unset on
every suspend individually taking the current configuration into
account every time.

OK, so one more status bit is needed, then.
