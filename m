I'm confused, SS and USB3.0 are the same essentially. It would be:

port@1/endpoint@0: SS host port
port@1/endpoint@1: SS device port

I think this case is rare enough that we don't need a general solution
using OF graph, so I'm fine with a simple, single property to link the
2 nodes. Either reusing "companion" or "renesas,host" is fine by me.
