Ah, this is you're correct. R-Car Gen3 code (drivers/usb/renesas_usbhs/rcar=
3.c) doesn't
have phy control for now.

I meant that USB peripheral of RZ/A2 need the phy driver, not a EHCI host d=
river.
And I read Figure 32.1 of the RZ/A2 documentation and I wonder if we need t=
o release
USBCTR.PLL_RST even if we use USB peripheral mode.

# Since the documentations doesn't mention the PHY area exactly, it's confu=
sable for us though.
# But, the phy driver assumed the driver handled "AHB Bridge", "Core" and "=
UCOM" registers.

Oh, I heard RZ/G1C also has such a hardware register [1].

[1] https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10655855/
RZ/G1C channel 0 only has UGCTRL register, but need to set for channel 1.
