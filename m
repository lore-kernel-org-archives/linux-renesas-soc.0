Subject: [PATCH 0/3] ARM/arm64: dts: renesas: Describe RTS/CTS hardware flow control
Date: Wed,  4 May 2016 10:57:55 +0200

	Hi Simon, Magnus,

This patch series updates the various Renesas DTSes to describe that
some UARTS have dedicated lines for RTS/CTS hardware flow control, and
that they are available for use (wired and enabled by pinmux
configuration), by adding the "uart-has-rtscts" property to
board-specific DTS files where appropriate.

While the actual DT binding updates documenting the "uart-has-rtscts"
property for SCIF(A) UARTs ("serial: sh-sci: Update DT binding
documentation for dedicated RTS/CTS") hasn't been accepted into tty-next
yet, this property is part of the Generic Serial DT Bindings
(Documentation/devicetree/bindings/serial/serial.txt), which has been
accepted.

Actual enablement of RTS/CTS hardware flow control (through setting the
CRTSCTS termios flag from userspace) depends on series "[PATCH v2 00/11]
serial: sh-sci: Hardware Flow Control Updates"
(http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-serial/msg22535.html).
Note that setting the CRTSCTS flag for a serial port that is being used
as the kernel console is a bad idea ;-) You'll have better luck with
UARTs on expansion connectors, cfr. the topic/renesas-overlays branch of
https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/geert/renesas-drivers.git

Thanks!

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
