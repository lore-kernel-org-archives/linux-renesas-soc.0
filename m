I understand -- the previous format was a lot more readable, here I had to
work to make the table as small as I could, and quite a few bits of readabi=
lity
were lost in the process. It's already a huge file.

I'm not sure if that would help, but here is the link to the old table
format I used
https://github.com/renesas-rz/rzn1_linux/blob/rzn1-stable/drivers/clk/rzn1/=
rzn1-clkctrl-tables.h

I had to throw that away to make up the new composite table that now contai=
ns
what was in the device tree file before. However the names are the same.

Perhaps I could change how I encode the register/bit pairs to use 8+8 bits =
to
make the hex constants more readable?

Well, I need these #define *somewhere* as I use them in my driver. So what
do you want me to do?
+ Remove the header, move the constants into the driver?
+ Use hard coded numbers in the DT and remove the header entirely?
+ Duplicate the header, keep the full one with the driver, and only list
the CA7+UART0 one in the dt-binding and duplicate the ones I need as
I go along?

Yes, the script logic hasn't changed in 2 years, and we've been using that
hierarchy extensively since.
Basically the logic is that if a clock doesn't have a gate and isn't a divi=
sor
of some sort, it's factored with it's parent clock... it used to be
done with a DT
alias of the same name.

Nope, as usual, people who wrote the documentation went their own way at
some point, and didn't backport any changes they made.
