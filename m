Hi Jacopo,

Thanks for the patches.

I'm going to give it a try on the RZ/A1 RSK board.

I can give it a try on things like Eth, I2C, SPI, SDHI, MMC.

SDHI is one that will need another parameter. Half the pins need Bidirectio=
n
(PBDC) enabled, and the other half need PBDC disabled.
SDHI data pins are PBDC=3D1, the others are PBDC=3D0.

Hmmm, I was hoping to 'easily' back port this to 4.9.
I guess if it's the best way forward, then maybe I can back port those new
generic functions for the LTSI tree.
