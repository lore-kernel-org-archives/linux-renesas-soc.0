:)
Unfortunately, I have one SDHC card that works, one that doesn't. Both card=
s
are running with a 50MHz SD clock. All I know is this:

SD cards that report unexpected interrupts:
2GB Sandisk Extreme III                     (e624 SD02G 1.89 GiB)
8GB Sandisk (SDHC class 4)              (aaaa SU08G 7.40 GiB)
8GB Sandisk Extreme III (SDHC class 6)    (bb4e SD08G 7.61 GiB)

SD cards that work ok:
16GB Samsung (microSDHC U1 class 10)          (0001 00000 14.6 GiB)
16GB Sandisk Ultra (microSDHC U1 class 10)    (aaaa SL16G 14.8 GiB)
32GB Sandisk Ultra (microSDHC U1 class 10)    (aaaa SL32G 29.7 GiB)

Thanks
Phil
