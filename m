Hi,

This series fixes two issues I encounter for bias handling in the PFC
while preparing my drive strength patch set.

I also attached a new patch 6/6 that adds the macro 
SH_PFC_PIN_NAMED_CFG() and was previously part of the series 'pinctrl: 
sh-pfc: r8a7795: Support none GPIO pins with configurable 
drive-strength'.

The reason I moved this patch to this series are both 6/6 and the new 
bias helper function introduced in 2/6 are dependencies for other PFC 
patch series I wish to send out. So to simplify the dependencies between 
series this looked like the best option, if not please let me know.

* Changes since v1
- Moved bias helper function from pfc-r8a7795.c to the sh-pfc core.
- Convert r8a7778 to use the new bias helper function.
- Fixed up spelling and attached Ack-tags.
- Attached a patch to add SH_PFC_PIN_NAMED_CFG() to simplify 
  dependencies for other series.

Niklas Söderlund (6):
  pinctrl: sh-pfc: Do not unconditionally support
    PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_DISABLE
  pinctrl: sh-pfc: Add helper to handle bias lookup table
  pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a7795: Simplify get bias logic
  pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a7795: Use lookup function for bias data
  pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a7778: Use lookup function for bias data
  pinctrl: sh-pfc: Support named pins with custom configuration
