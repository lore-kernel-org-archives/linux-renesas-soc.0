I did mean copy... I usually grep in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/,
and fall back to the spec only rarely, mostly because the spec usually
doesn't cover what I need.

I am aware of the ongoing work on updating the spec. I guess it's a
chicken-and-egg problem...

A list of standardized properties under Documentation/devicetree/bindings/,
referring to the spec may be a good interim solution. So at least it would show
it with git grep.

Thanks, nice!
