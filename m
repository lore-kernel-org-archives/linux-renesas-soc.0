Subject: [PATCH] i2c: rcar: fix resume by always initializing registers before transfer
Date: Tue, 18 Apr 2017 20:38:35 +0200
Message-Id: <20170418183835.13836-1-wsa+renesas@sang-engineering.com>
Sender: linux-renesas-soc-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-renesas-soc.vger.kernel.org>

Resume failed because of uninitialized registers. Instead of adding a
resume callback, we simply initialize registers before every transfer.
This lightweight change is more robust and will keep us safe if we ever
need support for power domains or dynamic frequency changes.

Morimoto-san: you convinced me that putting all register settings to one place
is a nice thing to do. Here is the patch for that. However, having
pm_runtime_get/put in one place won't work, I am afraid. For I2C slave or
multi-master support, we need permanent-on handling. So, I think the current
pm_runtime handling is good in that regard. Can you agree?
