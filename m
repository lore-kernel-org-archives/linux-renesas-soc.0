That's why we have the standard Fixes tag, which was included
Fixes: 9520b1a1b5f7a348 ("ARM: head-common.S: speed up startup code")

It's trivial for the repo maintainer to know which branch the fix to apply to,
given the Fixes tag.
It's non-trivial to know the branch for the patch submitter, who is forced to
use a non-standard patch submission system.
