See my point about drivers that don't implement bounce buffering.
Apparently NVMe is one of them, unlike the SATA/SCSI/MMC storage
drivers that do their own thing.

The problem again is the inconsistency of the API.

Absolutely.

What I think happened here in chronological order is:

- In the old days, 64-bit architectures tended to use an IOMMU 
  all the time to work around 32-bit limitations on DMA masters
- Some architectures had no IOMMU that fully solved this and the
  dma-mapping API required drivers to set the right mask and check
  the return code. If this failed, the driver needed to use its
  own bounce buffers as network and scsi do. See also the
  grossly misnamed "PCI_DMA_BUS_IS_PHYS" macro.
- As we never had support for bounce buffers in all drivers, and
  early 64-bit Intel machines had no IOMMU, the swiotlb code was
  introduced as a workaround, so we can use the IOMMU case without
  driver specific bounce buffers everywhere
- As most of the important 64-bit architectures (x86, arm64, powerpc)
  now always have either IOMMU or swiotlb enabled, drivers like
  NVMe started relying on it, and no longer handle a dma_set_mask
  failure properly.

We may need to audit how drivers typically handle dma_set_mask()
failure. The NVMe driver in its current state will probably cause
silent data corruption when used on a 64-bit architecture that has
a 32-bit bus but neither swiotlb nor iommu enabled at runtime.

I would argue that the driver should be fixed to either refuse
working in that configuration to avoid data corruption, or that
it should implement bounce buffering like SCSI does. If we make it
simply not work, then your suggestion of making dma_set_mask()
fail will break your system in a different way.

The DMA mapping API is meant to do this, but we can definitely improve
it or clarify some of the rules.

Ok.
