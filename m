Thanks!

Even after you pointed that out...I had to stare real hard to see it. I=20
guess the brain corrects what you see.

To be honest, I was not able to fully understand the issue in detail. I was=
 getting information through someone that was not in the design team. So to=
 be fair to the chip design guys, I want to avoid the word "broken".
They took the bit out of the hardware manual, and since the HW was designed=
 to work either way (and the default register setting is for fixed), I cons=
ider it an 'unsupported feature'.

So, how about a compromise of:

#define SDHI_INTERNAL_DMAC_ADDR_MODE_FIXED_ONLY 2

I don't think this applies to Gen3. This is just a RZ/A2 thing.

With that said, there are some Gen3 HW bugs that are in RZ/A2 HW, like the =
QSPI read bug. Since the RZ/A2 has the exact same HW as Gen3, it has the sa=
me HW bug. Now that one is a "bug", and I don't mind calling that one broke=
n.
