I worried about this but didn't think it would be too much of an issue.
But perhaps we should check...

<compile bounds.s in both configurations> as bounds.s.foo and bounds.s.main:

compiled with aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc, and with no debug enabled.

Other than the entry point rename (and section name) and the return
value being added, I can't see anything problematic here.

And as far as I know - this file gets processed after to extract
definitions which should be independent. This file is not executed or
further compiled as far as I am aware.
