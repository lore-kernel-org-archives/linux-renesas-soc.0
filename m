On RZ/A, yes. My comment was related to the R-Car Gen2 and Gen3 families.

This should just be "pin", not "renesas,pin".

Yes, I believe that should be done, especially given that the datasheet for 
the SoC is public. For other SoCs the current PFC driver model exposes the 
information needed to configure pin muxing even if you can't access the 
datasheet, which is an option that I'd hate losing.

That's correct, but a pinctrl-single-like driver could be implemented 
relatively easily without all the data tables. We might still need some data 
if we want to validate DT entries though, for instance to store the valid pin 
config and/or options for each pin.
