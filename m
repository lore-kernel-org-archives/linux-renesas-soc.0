I have mixed feelings about the last two renames, especially about the last
one: SYS-DMAC is very Renesas-specific, as it's a separate IP block in
Renesas SoCs.
1. Are there other SoCs using the same internal DMAC?
   If not, perhaps the "renesas" should be kept in the driver name?
2. Are there other SoCs using an external DMAC?
   Is the interface to the external DMAC similar?
   If yes, perhaps it should be renamed to tmio_mmc_sdhi_external_dmac.c?
   If not, perhaps the "renesas" should be kept in the driver name?

Thanks!
