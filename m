OK

For IRQ chips in particular, I think, you don't need add new fields to
struct dev_pm_info to make it work.

In ->suspend (or ->suspend_late, which may be better) you can check
the IRQD_WAKEUP_STATE flag of the irq_desc associated with the pin.
If that is set, you can simply set power.wakeup_path for the device
and that will make genpd skip it.  Wouldn't that work?

Thanks,
Rafael
