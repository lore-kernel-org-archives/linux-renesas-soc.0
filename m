Thank you for the patch set!
I tried to the patch using the topic branch.

I used r8a7790/Lager and the following card:

   SanDisk Card: SanDisk Extreme Pro 32Gb microSDHC U3
   (Sorry I don't have the packaging because I borrowed it from my colleague.)

< Result >
- It seems worked correctly.
- I tried 3 Lager boards:
 - One of board (No.701 / ES2.0) sometimes works correctly.
  - " mmc1: tuning execution failed: -110" appeared.
 - Other 2 boards (No.465 / ES2.0 and No.322 / ES3.0) always works correctly.

Perhaps the issue is related to hardware problem.

If SDR104 works:

If I remove sdr104 property and worked as SDR50:

Did you see such a message on your board?
