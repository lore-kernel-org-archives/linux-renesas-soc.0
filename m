Subject: [PATCH/RFC v2 0/3] UHS-I SDR-104 support for sh_mobile_sdhi

Hi,

this series is based on work by Ai Kyuse to add UHS-I SDR-104 support for
sh_mobile_sdhi. It builds on work by Shinobu Uehara, Rob Taylor, William
Towle and Ian Molton, Ben Hutchings, Wolfram Sang and others to add UHS-I
SDR-50 support to the same driver.

This series enables UHS-I SDR-104 on the r8a7790/Lager where
UHS-I SDR-50 is already enabled.

It is based on a merge of:
* The next branch of the mmc tree  
* The renesas-next-20160427v2-v4.6-rc1 tag of the renesas tree
* The sh-pfc-for-v4.7-tag1 tag of the renesas-drivers tree

The first two mmc driver patches are targeted at the next branch of the mmc
tree. The last DT patch is targeted at the devel branch of the renesas tree.

To aid review this series is provided in the _temporary_ topic/sdr104-v2 branch
of the renesas tree.


I received somewhat extensive review of v1 of this series and I have
attempted to rework, correspondingly extensively, these patches to reflect
that review. I apologise if I missed anything noted in v1. And given the
extent of the changes since then I fully expect to need to follow-up with v3.

A pleasant side effect of the above mentioned changes is
that v2 has roughly 40% fewer lines of code than v1 :)


Please see "[PATCH/RFC 0/3] UHS-I SDR-104 support for sh_mobile_sdhi" for
indicative test results: I do not believe the numbers have not changed
in a material way since then.
