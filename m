No they're not. You do realize that we can build a temporary struct
device_connection there and then (in stack) to be supplied for the
->match callback.

I don't see any need for that. We may need to modify struct
device_connection, but there should not be any need to touch the API.

Your plan to use port and endpoint number is wrong, as they are just
indexes, and therefore not reliable. Luckily it should be completely
unnecessary to use them.

The way I see this working is that we parse all the endpoints the
caller device has. If we can't take advantage of the con_id for
identification (though ideally we can), we just need to call ->match
with every one of them. The implementation for the ->match callback is
then responsible of figuring out if the endpoint is the one we are
looking for or not in that case.

The only problem I see with that is that we may not have a reliable
way to convert the fwnode pointing to the remote-endpoint parent into
struct device (if one has already been enumerated) in order to get the
device name and use it as the second endpoint name in struct
device_connection. To solve that, we could consider for example just
adding a new member, fwnode pointer perhaps, to the structure. Or
perhaps use the endpoint members for something else than device names
when graph is used, and add a member defining the type of match:
graph, build-in, etc. There are many things we can consider.

I don't know if I'm able to explain what I'm after with this, so if
you like, I can propose something for this myself. Though that will
have to wait for few weeks. Right now I'm too busy with other stuff.
