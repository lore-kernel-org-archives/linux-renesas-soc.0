This should only ever be accessed by the Xen DMA code via the
is_device_dma_coherent() helper, so I can't see the change of storage
type causing any problems.

Should we clear dma_ops_setup here for symmetry? I guess in practice
it's down to the IOMMU driver so will never change after the first
probe, but it still feels like a bit of a nagging loose end.

With that (or firm reassurance that it's OK not to),

Apologies for being too arm64-focused in the earlier reviews and
overlooking this. Should the patch supersede 8674/1 currently in
Russell's incoming box?
