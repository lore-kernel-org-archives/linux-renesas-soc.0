The good news is that, given that no code uses this new API at the moment, 
there isn't much to audit. The patch series implements the resource mapping 
for arch/arm only, and makes use of it in the rcar-dmac driver only. Would you 
like anything audited else than the arch/arm dma mapping implementation, the 
rcar-dmac driver and the code that then deals with the dma addresses (I'm 
thinking about the IOMMU subsystem and the ipmmu-vmsa driver in particular) ?
