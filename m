Yes, if it is always on (or simply has no enable-gpio) then we might
select a voltage while probing the device. My point is: At some point
(probably when the first consumer probes, but I think there are no
guarantees) the core will switch the regulator state. That usually
happens a few milliseconds to seconds after probing the regulator
itself. This seems to be nothing but a source of undefined behaviour.

If continuous operation of the regulator is important, I'd expect
we don't touch whatever the firmware setup instead of by default
setting all gpios to low.

However as we can't change this now, there isn't much point in
discussin this further.

I think it should be clearer that this is an array. (Looking at various
users I doubt everybody was aware of that, but since we have only instances
with one gpio, there is no functional difference between array and bit field.)
Also it should be recommended to set this to match whatever the bootloader
sets up. Maybe something like:

- gpios-states: Array of GPIOs values set during probing the regulator.
		0: LOW, 1: HIGH. If continous operation during boot is
		desired, this needs to match what the firmware or bootloader
		sets up. By default all GPIOs are set to low during probing.

HTH,
Harald
