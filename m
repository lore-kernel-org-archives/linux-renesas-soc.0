Hi Geert and Laurent,

This series adds support to control the drive strength for none GPIO
pins. All pins which can have its drive strength controlled is now supported. I 
have also added the new pins to the correct groups, or added groups to mimic 
other sh-pfc drivers. One notable exception is the group avb_mdc which on other 
SoC are called avb_mdio, see commit 3/4 for explanation.

The series is based on top of v4.9-rc3 and tested on Salvator-X. My test
is a bit crude and is setting a few of the AVB pins to a higher
drive-strength value then the others and observing that the AVB fails to
work after the pfc settings are applied (NFS root failing to mount after
kernel is fetched over TFTP). I also tested setting the drive strength for 
individual pins and for whole groups.

Changes since v1

- Add comment about that it's the R-Car H3SiP pin matrix which is used to 
  generate a unique id number for each pin. Even if the pin matrix are 
  different on other packages all the driver care about is that it's a unique 
  number.

- Add FSCLKST pin after discussion with Geert

- Moved avb_mii group relative to other avb pin groups for a more logical 
  order, thanks Sergei for pointing this out

- Add Acked-by and Reviewed-by tags

- Fixed spelling error
