Driver init functions declared using *_OF_DECLARE() are called exactly once.
Hence if they fail, they are never retried. Calling order among subsystems is
hardcoded, and the actual order was determined by historical reasons (legacy
PC systems with always-on clocks and power domains ;-).
This breaks as soon as e.g. timers or interrupt controllers start depending
on clocks and/or power domains.

Drivers using the device driver framework are retried later when their init
function returns -EPROBE_DEFER. So (eventually) they all succeed
initialization.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
