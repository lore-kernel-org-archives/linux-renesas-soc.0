Subject: [PATCH 00/12] i2c: quirks: add zero length checks and update drivers
Date: Mon, 23 Jul 2018 22:26:04 +0200

I had this idea for quite some time on my todo list but a soon to be
implemented refactoring in the i2c-rcar driver now finally made me do it. Add a
'can't do 0 length messages' quirk to the quirk infrastructure for and remove
the manual handling from the drivers. This makes the quirk much more visible.
(Quite some prominent vendors in that list) We also have a centralized place to
handle updates to the quirk detection if that is ever needed.

I have tested this with the i2c-rcar and i2c-sh_mobile driver on a Renesas
SalvatorXS board equipped with M3-N (r8a77965).

A git branch can be found here:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/wsa/linux.git i2c/quirk-no-zero-len

Looking forward to comments, reviews, tests...

Thanks,

   Wolfram
