Subject: Applied "ASoC: rcar: unregister fixed rate on ADG" to the asoc tree
Sender: linux-renesas-soc-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-renesas-soc.vger.kernel.org>

The patch

   ASoC: rcar: unregister fixed rate on ADG

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: rcar: unregister fixed rate on ADG

ADG is registering fixed rate clock for audio_clkout, but it had not
been unregister clock when removing.

Salvator-X board is using ak4613 driver now, and it supports
hw_constraints from commit 907cd8809eebc ("ASoC: ak4613: add
hw_constraint rule for Sampling Rate").
And this calculation is using input clk. This ak4613 input clock is
ADG clkout on Salvator-X.

Because ADG had not been unregister clkout when unbinding, it receives
fixed rate clk register error when re-binding.
Thus, ak4613 can't get correct input clock, and hw_constraints will be
failed after re-binding.
This means Salvator-X board can't use sound after unbind/bind.

This patch solves this issue.
