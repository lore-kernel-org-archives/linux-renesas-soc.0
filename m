I think we can trivially bring and end to speculation on the presence of a
user in arch/sh:

$ make kernelrelease
4.9.0-rc7
$ grep -r sh_flctl arch/sh/
arch/sh/boards/mach-ap325rxa/setup.c:#include <linux/mtd/sh_flctl.h>
arch/sh/boards/mach-ap325rxa/setup.c:static struct sh_flctl_platform_data nand_flash_data = {
arch/sh/boards/mach-ap325rxa/setup.c:   .name           = "sh_flctl",

For now I think it would be best if this thread served to document that
sh7372 support should be removed either when another user of the bindings
is added or when DT support is removed from the driver.
