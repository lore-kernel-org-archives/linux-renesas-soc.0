Yes, but that is the hole point.

If a child device needs to stay powered as to deal with wakeup, so is
required by the parent.

Yes, but wakeup_path is only telling half of what is needed.

Because even if wakeup_path becomes set for a parent device, doesn't
mean that it must stay in full power during system suspend to serve
wakeups for a child. That's why I think the DPM_FLAG_WAKEUP_POWERED
flag needs to be propagated also.

Kind regards
