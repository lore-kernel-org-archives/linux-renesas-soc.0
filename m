That's another option, but it seems more like a workaround to me, inste=
ad of a=20
proper solution to fix the more global problem of multiple memory paths=
 within=20
a single device. I have other hardware devices that can act as bus mast=
ers=20
through different paths (for instance a display-related device that fet=
ches=20
data and commands through different paths). Luckily so far all those pa=
ths are=20
served by the same IOMMU, but there's no guarantee this will remain tru=
e in=20
the future. Furthermore, even today, the IOMMU connected to that device=
 has=20
the ability to selectively enable and disable its ports. I have to keep=
 them=20
all enabled due to the lack of channel information in the DMA mapping a=
nd=20
IOMMU APIs, leading to increased power consumption.
