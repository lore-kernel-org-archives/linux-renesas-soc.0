Ah no, sorry for not being clear earlier. I was referring to below code
snippet in drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq-dt.c

162         cpu_clk = clk_get(cpu_dev, NULL);

163         if (IS_ERR(cpu_clk)) {

164                 ret = PTR_ERR(cpu_clk);

165                 dev_err(cpu_dev, "%s: failed to get clk: %d\n",
__func__, ret);
166                 return ret;

167         }

Now on systems using r8a7796.dtsi, if you hotplug out all A53s and
hotplug back in A53_3 first, that should trigger cpufreq_driver->init
from cpufreq_online which should result in execution above code.

If that takes patch of__of_clk_get_by_name, then that may be problem.
I was originally point at this when I referred hotplug and was not PSCI
related.
