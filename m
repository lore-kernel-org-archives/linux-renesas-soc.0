Dropping the above hung makes sense to me.

Out of interest, what would be the implication of removing
existing aliases?

Thanks, as per my comment below I wonder if as well as documenting
"renesas,iic-r8a77990" we also to teach the driver about it.

My cursory reading of the driver indicates that only register that is
used by it but documented as not existing on E3 is ICSTART (offset 0x70).

It seems to me that we should confirm with Renesas that the register does
indeed not exist - as this patch comes from the BSP which implies it is
being used there. And if it does not exist we should try teaching the
driver not to use ICSTART via the "renesas,iic-r8a77990" compat string.
What do you think?

I can't explain 0x34 but I agree 0x15 would match the documentation.
