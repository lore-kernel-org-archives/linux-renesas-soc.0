Hi Rob, Laurent,

Thanks for the response.

Yes, as Laurent mentioned, the external master will be described separately=
. The data interface with the master is described through port nodes. E.g.

        port {
                drif0_ep: endpoint {
                     remote-endpoint =3D <&tuner_ep>;
                };
        };

Do we agree on this model please?

Can we use this "bonding" property as another way of grouping similar devic=
es? Should I make it generic instead of "renesas,bonding"?

Thanks,
