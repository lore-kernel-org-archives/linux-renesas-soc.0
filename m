What is not clear to me is whether the endpoint link state can really be
in electrical idle (so ready for L1) if it has not received a
PM_Request_Ack DLLP from the host controller.

It is not clear whether the host controller sends it upon PM_Enter_L1
DLLP reception (ie does it actually carry out step 9 in PCIe specs
5.3.2.1 "Entry into L1 state") or it has to be coerced into L1 to send
it.

I agree with Bjorn that this is not clear at all and it boils down to
how HW is designed. We need to understand what "Endpoint in L1, RP in
L0" means in this context and for that we need an errata document
otherwise that's impossible to untangle.
