...and this one may be out of date. All other instances for Xilinx
gpio use 2 cells.

We also have to look for custom translate functions of which there are
a handful, but they all use standard flags.

Looks like we already warn in the kernel if <2. Might be worth adding
this to dtc, then I can get the warning without booting a kernel on
platforms I don't have.

The move to standardize flags started before the Great ARM Conversion,
so I would have expected some old PPC DTs. But it looks like we are
good.
