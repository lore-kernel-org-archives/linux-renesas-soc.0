Yes, this is probably the main reason.

However, as stated, I think we should look into addressing this
problem more carefully, in a separate next step.

Sorry, but I am not fully understanding what you suggest here. Perhaps
you didn't check patch2?

Removing these APIs and functions is done in patch2, so I guess I am
already doing what you suggests above? No?
