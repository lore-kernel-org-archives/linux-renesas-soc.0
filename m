Just had a closer look at how it's setup here.
Maybe the following helps.

The designware core is routed thru the fpga fabric.
Which provides and SCL SDA output enable pin.

Recovery gpio are provided by a FPGA gpio IO core.
This core has a fixed output and fixed input.

Here's the relevant bit on how it's all combined.
PWR_SDA_a / PWR_SCL_a are the signals to the outside world.
All the other signals are internal

   I2c0_Dat_s <= PWR_SDA_a;
   I2c0_Clk_s <= PWR_SCL_a;
   PWR_SDA_a <= '0' when  (I2c0_Dat_Oe_s = '1') else 'Z';

This bit of logic combines the i2c core and gpios.
   PWR_SCL_a <= '0' when ((I2c0_Clk_Oe_s = '1') or (PWR_SCL_rec_s = '0')) else 'Z';

     , pio_io_in_port(1)                   => PWR_SCL_a
     , pio_io_in_port(2)                   => PWR_SDA_a

     , pio_io_out_port(1)                  => PWR_SCL_rec_s

pio_io_out_port port is the fixed config for output
pio_io_in_port is the fixed config for input

The gpio input / outputs exist in the same ip core.

PWR_SCL_rec_s is the recovery clock gpio signal. It needs to be driven high / low.
There's no concept of HiZ internally in the FPGA.

If there was some kinda of OpenDrain gpio driver that modelled a FET driven by a push pull GPIO I guess
it could be made to work.
