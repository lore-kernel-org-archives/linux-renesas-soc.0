That's correct: my original motivation for picking up Sergei's patches was to
make Ethernet work after suspend/resume on the same Salvator-XS board.

The main difference seems to be that I was using NFS root, while Shimoda-san
is using an initramfs.  Hence there probably is an inconsistency in reset
handling for an active vs. inactive Ethernet interface.
