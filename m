Subject: [PATCH v4 00/14] r8a7793, gose: Add audio support to device tree
Date: Mon, 18 Jan 2016 14:27:55 +0900

Hi,

this series adds support to r8a7793 and gose device trees for
rcar sound: first in PIO mode then using DMA

I have been unable to test if audio works (in PIO mode) as I
do not have physical access to a gose board. I would appreciate
some assistance there.

This work is based heavily on the work of others for the r8a7791 and
koelsch as noted in the changelogs of individual patches.

This series is based on renesas-devel-20160111-v4.4 and
has no other dependencies that I am aware of.

Changes between v3 and v4
* Use GIC_SPI in interrupt properties

Changes between v2 and v3
* Minor changelog tweaks

Changes since v1 and v2:
* Dropped RFC designation
* Dropped i2c patches: they have been posted and partially merged separately
* Dropped MIX/CTU support pending more work on that feature
* Enable Audio DMAC peri peri via sound driver
* Other changes noted in per-patch changelogs
