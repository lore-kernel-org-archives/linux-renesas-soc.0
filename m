Geert seems to want us to consider this further.

As DT describes hardware it seems reasonable that we should describe the
TMU device fully in DT, including all IRQs. But it seems to me that the
documentation may not be consistent enough to judge how to do that.
So perhaps a way forwards is to seek clarification of the documentation?
