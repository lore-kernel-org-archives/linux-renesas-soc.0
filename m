Hi Sergei,

I think the prefix of this patch should be "clk: shmobile: rcar-gen2: "

Hi Geert,

I apologise if I have missed a discussion of this topic or if my analysis
is wrong for some reason but I am curious to know what the intended way
is for the rcar-gen2 CPG driver to handle differences in the availability
of clocks across different SoCs.

My possibly naïve expectation is that the implementation would use compat
strings. But as it stands it appears that all clocks supported by the
driver are available for all SoCs. This does not seem to reflect the
documentation (v2.00).

FWIW my quick analysis of clocks supported by the driver present in
renesas-drivers-2016-05-31-v4.7-rc1 but not present on one or more SoCs
is as follows:

Not present on V2H: sdh, sd0
Not present on V2H or E2: sd1
Not present on H2, M2-W, M2-N, E2: rcan
