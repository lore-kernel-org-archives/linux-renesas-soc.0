  ARM: dts: r8a7743: Add MSIOF[012] support (2017-09-28 08:02:04 +0200)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Renesas ARM Based SoC DT Updates for v4.15

* r7s72100 (RZ/A1) Peach board
  - Add pin groups for SCIF2 serial debug interface and Ethernet
    This avoids relying on bootloader settings
  - Support control of LED1 using gpio-leds

* r8a7743 (RZ/G1M) and r8a7745 (RZ/G1E) SoCs
  - Add MSIOF[012] support and define aliases for spi[0123]

* r8a7743 (RZ/G1M) SoC
  - Add I2C and IIC core nodes

* r8a7743 (RZ/G1M) iW-RainboW-G20D-Qseven development platform
   - Enable SDHI1 SD controller supporting high-speed and SDR50 transfers
   - Add chosen node to allow correct selection of serial console
     and the kernel command line
   - Enable RTC support
   - Enable USB2.0 host support
     This includes enabling USB PHY and internal PCI

* r8a7743 (RZ/G1M) iW-RainboW-G20M-Qseven and
  r8a7745 (RZ/G1E) iW-RainboW-G22M-SM SoMs
   - Enable Add SPI NOR support
     This devices is used to boot up the system to the SoM DT

* r8a7743 (RZ/G1M) iW-RainboW-G20M-Qseven SoM
  - Enable SDHI0 SD controller supporting high-speed transfers

* r8a7745 (RZ/G1E) iW-RainboW-G22D development platform
  - Add pnctl support for scif4
    This avoids reling on boot loader settings
  - Add EtherAVB support

* r8a7745 (RZ/G1E) iW-RainboW-G22M-SM SoM
  - Add basic SoM support
  - Enable MMCIF eMMC support
  - Enable RTC support
  - Enable SDHI1 SD controller supporting high-speed transfers

* r8a779[0-4] R-Car Gen2 SoCs
  - Add reset control properties
    Geert Uytterhoeven says:

    This patch series describes the reset topology on all R-Car Gen2 Socs,
    like was done before for R-Car Gen3 and RZ/G1.

    Resets usually match the corresponding module clocks.  Exceptions are:
      - The audio module has resets for the Serial Sound Interfaces only,
      - The display module has only a single reset for all DU channels, but
	adding reset properties for the display is postponed upon request
	from Laurent.

   - Convert to new CPG/MSSR bindings
     Geert Uytterhoven says:

     Currently Renesas R-Car Gen2 SoCs use the common clk-rcar-gen2,
     clk-mstp, and clk-div6 drivers, which depend on most clocks being
     described in DT.  Especially the module (MSTP) clocks are cumbersome
     and error prone, due to 3 arrays (clocks, clock-indices, and
     clock-output-names) to be kept in sync. In addition, the clk-mstp
     driver cannot be extended easily to also support module resets, which
     are provided by the same hardware module.

     Hence when developing support for R-Car Gen3 SoCs, another approach
     was chosen, which led to the CPG/MSSR driver core, and SoC-specific
     subdrivers (initially for R-Car Gen3, but later also for RZ/G1).

     This series converts the various R-Car Gen2 DTSes to migrate to the
     new CPG/MSSR drivers that were added in v4.13-rc1.

* r8a779[0,1,3,4] R-Car Gen2 SoCs
  - Stop grouping clocks under a "clocks" subnode
    Geert Uytterhoeven says:

    The current practice is to not group clocks under a "clocks" subnode,
    but just put them together with the other on-SoC devices.

    Hence this patch series implements this for the various R-Car Gen2
    DTSes that still need this (r8a7792.dtsi is OK).

* r8a7794 (E2) Alt board
  - Correct inverted sense of SD wip pins
