Yeah, I got this point. But it is the meaning of your sentence: "...
which causes issues with complex dependencies.".

It is ambiguous *what* causes the issues.

Did you meant an attempt was done to support EPROBE_DEFER with
*_OF_DECLARE but caused too much issues with the complex dependencies?

Or the current situation is causing too much issues with the complex
dependencies?

(I know the latter is true, it is about the meaning of the sentence).
