Joy.

If we need to do something here, we should clarify the semantics of
wakeup-source and/or introduce a property which is explicitly for the
purpose of expressing HW capability to wake up from a specific power
state.

Sure; userspace can always do something silly here.

As I mentioned in my other reply, we could/should add an interface to
allow userspace to determine if it has a guaranteed wakeup, which would
allow us to do the right thing.

Thanks,
Mark.
