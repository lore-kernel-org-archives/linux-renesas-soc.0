I just tried v4.11-rc1 with the RSK and it boots fine. However:
 1. The RSK DTS is not probing a I2C EEPROM on boot like the GENMAI DTS (wh=
ich is
    Where the hang up seems to be)

 2. There is no PFC code yet upstream, (my RSK/u-boot has it) so now that
   the driver is actually waiting for a STOP condition, it might never get =
it because
   the pins are not actually configured.

When I get to the office, I'll dig out my GENMAI board and try it.
