Subject: [PATCH 0/2] mmc: renesas_sdhi: avoid bad TAPs for Gen3

Here is a series which avoids using TAPs on R-Car Gen3 SoCs which are
bad to use according to HW engineers. The patch was originally for the
BSP (Thanks, Saito-san) and has been upported for the upstream driver.
Before we can apply this, we need to add some mising information for
R-Car M3-W ES1.[23].

Patches have been tested on Renesas Salvator-XS boards with R-Car H3
ES2.0 (changing from TAP3 to TAP4 here) and R-Car M3-N (changing from
TAP7 to TAP0 here).

A branch can be found here:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/wsa/linux.git renesas/sdhi/new_manual_calib

It is based on current mmc/next + "[PATCH] mmc: renesas_sdhi: shorten
types after refactorization"

One implementation detail: For now, I kept using a generic naming for
the quirks, e.g. "sdhi_quirks_bad_taps2367". It is possible that we need
to rename/add ones later which are SoC bound, e.g. "sdhi_quirks_m3w_30".
Especially when we add manual calibration somewhen. But for now, the
generic approach seems better to me, so I sticked to it.

Looking forward to further comments and/or testing.

Happy hacking,

   Wolfram
