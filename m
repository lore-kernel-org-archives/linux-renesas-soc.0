This patch set is for R-Car Gen3 Salvator-XS boards. If we do
the following method, the phy cannot link up correctly.

 1) Kernel boots by using initramfs.
 --> No open the nic, so phy_device_register() and phy_probe()
     deasserts the reset.
 2) Kernel enters the suspend.
 --> So, keep the reset signal as deassert.
 --> On R-Car Salvator-XS board, unfortunately, the board power is
     turned off.
 3) Kernel returns from suspend.
 4) ifconfig eth0 up
 --> Then, since edge signal of the reset doesn't happen,
     it cannot link up.
 5) ifconfig eth0 down
 6) ifconfig eth0 up
 --> In this case, it can link up.

When resolving this issue after I got feedback from Andrew and Heiner,
I found an issue that the phy_device.c didn't call phy_resume()
if the PHY was not attached. So, patch 1 fixes it and add toggling
the phy reset to the micrel phy driver.

Changes from v1 (as RFC):
 - No remove the current code of phy_device.c to avoid any side effects.
 - Fix the mdio_bus_phy_resume() in phy_device.c.
 - Add toggling the phy reset in micrel.c if the PHY is not attached.
