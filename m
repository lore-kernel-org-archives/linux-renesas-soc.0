That's missing n=4 and n=32. While SGASYNCD32 isn't referenced in the
datasheet, SGASYNCD4 is (in SCIF and HSCIF). Maybe that's just an
oversight ?

Yes, I was talking about the clocks documented in the various
non-PLL "hierarchy" sections.

An additional difficulty is that we don't actually know what clocks the
MDLC gates :-/

A big *iff* :-)

Even in that case, we'll have (at least) two issues:

- Some modules may need to know the rate of the functional clock gated
  by the MDLC. As those clocks are controlled through power domains,
  they are only specified as the last cell of the power-domains
  property, and are not listed in the clocks property. How do you
  envision this to work ?

- When multiple clocks derive from the same PLL, it's common for the PLL
  rate to be specified through assigned-clock-rates. If we want to
  continue doing that, we need to to make the whole clock hierarchy
  available to DT.

So we could add e.g. SGASYNCD32 already, as long as we don't reference
it in DT without testing.
