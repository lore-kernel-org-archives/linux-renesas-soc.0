Well, the warnings are a bit noisy in that they get repeated, can be
misleading, change as I fix problems (device nodes are not checked if
the bridge node fails), and most importantly I'm lazy having fixed
these treewide. Sub-arch maintainers are welcome to make better
patches. :)

Most of these are because 'device_type = "pci";' should only be on PCI
bridges, not PCI devices.

Yeah, they are still out there. Just need to google "PCI supplement 1275". :)

I have the full archive saved off. I need to get them added to devicetree.org.
