First, did you confirm that genpd was used? Then for what device?

Second, did you check the call to pm_runtime_force_suspend() called by
genpd, is the reason to the error messages?

Third, it should be sufficient to add DPM_FLAG_IN_BAND_WAKEUP for the
driver that is actually dealing with the wakeup. Although, does this
driver's system ->suspend() callback check device_may_wakeup(), before
it decides to enable wakeup?
If not, the PM core and genpd don't notice that wakeup is enabled for
the device.

Great, thanks.
