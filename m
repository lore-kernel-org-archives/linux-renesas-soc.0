OK, so clearly PME scans should be suspended before the host bridge
registers become inaccessible.

Another question, though, is whether or not PME scans are actually necessary
on the affected platforms at all.

Pretty much. :-)

The PME scans cannot run on a suspended host bridge.

It's never worked IMO.
