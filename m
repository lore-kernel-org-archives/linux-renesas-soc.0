They are 'optional' in the sense that if you don't include them in the=20
DT, the driver still loads (just without any GPIO, but pinctrl still=20
works). So, I was just documenting that fact.

If you think I should just move these to required, let me know an I'm=20
fine with that. (as in, DT documents HW, not software)

Now that I read this, I think my wording was off (I was borrowing text=20
for other files).

How about this:

The child nodes of the pin controller designate pins to be used for
specific peripheral functions or as GPIO.
