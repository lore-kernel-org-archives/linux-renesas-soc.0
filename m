I tested this patch with the SD tester. After I applied this patch, when th=
e R1_CARD_ECC_FAILED
is set, the following message appeared:

mmcblk1: error -5 sending stop command, original cmd response 0x900, card s=
tatus 0x900

However, I have a question about "ecc_err" in both mmc_blk_err_check() and =
mmc_blk_cmd_recovery().
Anyway, I tested this patch. And the mmc core said some error happened.
I think this is suitable behavior. So,

Tested-by: Yoshihiro Shimoda <yoshihiro.shimoda.uh@renesas.com>

< Question >
In mmc_blk_cmd_recovery(), if "brq->stop.resp[0] & R1_CARD_ECC_FAILED" is t=
rue, ecc_err is set to true.
However, in mmc_blk_err_check(), ecc_err is only referred when brq->data.er=
ror is true.
So, I guess we need a patch like below as another patch. What do you think?

diff --git a/drivers/mmc/core/block.c b/drivers/mmc/core/block.c

-       if (brq->data.error) {
+       if (brq->data.error || ecc_err) {
                if (need_retune && !brq->retune_retry_done) {
                        pr_debug("%s: retrying because a re-tune was needed=
\n",
                                 req->rq_disk->disk_name);

After that, the mmc core also output the following message:

mmcblk1: error 0 transferring data, sector 0, nr 128, cmd response 0x900, c=
ard status 0x200b00
mmcblk1: retrying using single block read

Best regards,
