That's indeed what we do, typically.

I don't have a real preference.

Two cautions, though:
  1. You do have to remember to increase port_names[], when needed,
  2. Trying to predict the future may fail, and more driver updates may be
     needed when a new variant of this pin controller will be conceived.
