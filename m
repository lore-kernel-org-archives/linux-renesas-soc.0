In the mean time:
  - I renamed pfc-r8a7795es1.c to pfc-r8a7795-es1.c for compatibility with
    the BSP, but I'm not gonna spam everybody with a v3 for such a trivial
    change.
  - I verified all physical pins against the R-Car H3 pin function rev0.551
    and the R-Car H3SiP pin arrangement rev1.53 documents. No updates needed.

So I've queued the remainder (patches 2-4) up in sh-pfc-for-v4.12.
