I don't know if using the same handler for all separate interrupts won't cause
problems. What if two interrupts fire, the first one calls the common handler,
handles both, and the second one returns IRQ_NONE? Spurious interrupts
detected by the core interrupt, leading to "Disabling IRQ #n" once it has seen
too many of them?
