Subject: [PATCH 3/9] ARM: dts: r8a77(43|9[013]): Add missing OPP properties for CPUs
Date: Fri, 20 Jul 2018 14:05:11 +0200
Message-Id: <422ee8b4c445f4ff545857465514634d21f5d2b2.1532086734.git.horms+renesas@verge.net.au>
In-Reply-To: <cover.1532086734.git.horms+renesas@verge.net.au>
References: <cover.1532086734.git.horms+renesas@verge.net.au>
Sender: linux-renesas-soc-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-renesas-soc.vger.kernel.org>

From: Viresh Kumar <viresh.kumar@linaro.org>

The OPP properties, like "operating-points", should either be present
for all the CPUs of a cluster or none. If these are present only for a
subset of CPUs of a cluster then things will start falling apart as soon
as the CPUs are brought online in a different order. For example, this
will happen because the operating system looks for such properties in
the CPU node it is trying to bring up, so that it can create an OPP
table.

Add such missing properties.

Fix other missing properties (like, clock latency, voltage tolerance,
etc) as well to make it all work.
