That assumes you keep the list of machines to check, and don't want to fix the
issue automatically when detected (on any R-Car Gen2 or RZ/G1 platform, so
you still need to check for r8a779[0-4] and r8a774[23457]).

Anyway, as we care about booting old DTBs on new kernels (for a while), we
have a few more release cycles to bikeshed ;-)
