While I completely agree we don't want *only* generic compatibles nor
generic gpio and power control, I think timing values in DT are fine.
They are just data copied out of datasheets and aren't tweaked per
platform. If the same data would make sense to put into a display
EDID, I think it also makes sense to put that data in DT.
