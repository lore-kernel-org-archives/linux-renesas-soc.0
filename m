This means that ftrace can not be used for the of_node_get(),
of_node_put(), and of_node_release() debug info, because
these functions are called before early_initcall().  Please
use pr_debug() for these functions.

As far as I know, the of_reconfig_notify() could remain an
ftrace instrumented function.  But now that the only thing
that would be ftrace instrumented is of_reconfig_notify(),
I don't see a strong justification for changing the existing
pr_debug() calls to an ftrace alternative.  Though I suspect
the original author of the patch still might desire to have
the "#ifdef DEBUG" surrounding the pr_debug() calls removed
since one of his issues was having to recompile his kernel
to do his debugging.
