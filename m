Subject: [PATCH v2 2/3] PM / core: Add IN_BAND_WAKEUP driver flag
Date: Mon, 13 Nov 2017 16:46:42 +0100

For some bus types and PM domains, it's not sufficient to only check the
return value from device_may_wakeup(), to fully understand how to configure
wakeup settings for the device during system suspend.

In particular, sometimes the device may need to remain in its power state,
in case the driver has configured it for in band IRQs, as to be able to
generate wakeup signals. Therefore, define and document an IN_BAND_WAKEUP
driver flag, to enable drivers to instruct bus types and PM domains about
this setting.

Of course, in case the bus type and PM domain has additional information
about wakeup settings of the device, they may override the behaviour.

Using the IN_BAND_WAKEUP driver flag for a device, may also affect how bus
types and PM domains should treat the device's parent during system
suspend. Therefore, in __device_suspend(), let the PM core propagate the
wakeup setting by using a status flag in the struct dev_pm_info for the
parent. This also makes it consistent with how the existing "wakeup_path"
status flag is being assigned.

Changes in v2:
	- Fixed comments from Rafael:
	  - Rename flag to IN_BAND_WAKEUP.
	  - Clarify doc and changelog.
	  - Use a separate status flag when propagating to parents in PM core.
	- I didn't add Geert's Reviewed-by, because of new changes.

 might identify GPIO signals hooked up to a switch or other external hardware,
 and :c:func:`pci_enable_wake()` does something similar for the PCI PME signal.
 
+Sometimes :c:func:`device_may_wakeup(dev)` is not sufficient to understand how a
+wakeup signal needs to be configured. Particularly, in some cases the driver
+needs to instruct bus types and PM domains, that it has configured the device to
+use an in-band wakeup setting, which may require the device to remain in its
+power state to be able to generate wakeup signals. Therefore, drivers can set
+``DPM_FLAG_IN_BAND_WAKEUP`` in :c:member:`power.driver_flags`, by passing the
+flag to :c:func:`dev_pm_set_driver_flags` helper, which instructs bus types and
+PM domains to use this configuration. However, the bus types and PM domains may
+override this setting, in case they have additional information about wakeup
+settings of the device.
+
 If any of these callbacks returns an error, the system won't enter the desired
 low-power state.  Instead, the PM core will unwind its actions by resuming all
 the devices that were suspended.
