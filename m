Yes, that matches the RZ/A1 SCIFA and interrupt controller docs.

Right, the RZ/A2 SCIFA variant is documented to provide 6 interrupt sources:
  1. TEI,
  2. TXI,
  3. RXI,
  4. DRI,
  5. ERI,
  6. BRI.

Listing them twice does make sense to me, as the interrupt controller
source list in the RZ/A2 docs has only four, and explicitly lists how they are
multiplexed:
  base + 0 = ERI/BRI,
  base + 1 = RXI,
  base + 2 = TXI,
  base + 3 = TEI/DRI.
But future SoCS with the same SCIFA variant may wire them differently?

For DT backwards compatibility, we have to keep support for the following
2 schemes:
  1. Single "interrupts" value, no "interrupt-names", for fully multiplexed
     interrupts (SH/R-Mobile, R-Car).
  2. Four "interrupts" values, no "interrupt-names", for ERI/RXI/TXI/TEI
     (RZ/A1, H8/300).

For RZ/A2, I suggest extending the bindings with interrupt-names,
documenting all 6 interrupt sources, and let the driver handle that.
That means there should be 6, not 5, "interrupts" values.
Whether the driver implements all possible combinations, or only what you
need for RZ/A2, is up to you. I agree the interrupt handling in the driver
is already sufficiently complex.
Ideally, you would document support for RZ/A1 with interrupt-names too,
and handle that as well.

Does this make sense?
Thanks!
