So the question is how to model unconnected external clocks in device-
tree.

The dtsi we're loooking at has (in pseudo dt):

device {
  clock-names = "internal", "external";
  clocks = <&internal, &external>
};

external {
  compatible = "fixed-clock";
  clock-frequency = <12345>;
  status = "disabled";
};

Before 3e5dd6f6e690048d ("clk: Ignore disabled DT clock providers")
this apparently worked. Afterwards drivers getting all the clocks would
fail to probe with -EPROBE_DEFER.

Judging by your comment I assume this way of modelling it is broken
(and the behaviour caused by the patch is correct)? 

And as a follow-up, is modelling unconnected clocks as enabled with a
frequency of 0hz as my proposed patch does seen as the right way of
doing things?
