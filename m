Subject: [RFC PATCH 0/4] i2c: document DMA handling and add helper
Date: Tue,  6 Jun 2017 11:20:30 +0200

So, after revisiting old mail threads and taking part in a similar discussion
on the USB list, here is an RFC on what I cooked together regarding DMA and I2C
in the Linux world.

I documented my reasoning with patch 2 which mentions a helper function which
gets added with patch 1. Patch 3 shows a super simple example with the
i2c-sh_mobile driver. And patch 4 shows a super complicated example with the
i2c-rcar driver. But it is nice to have such a corner case already in the
beginning of development.

Please let me know what you think. What I surely plan to add until next time is
to fix two central places in the I2C core where the data buffer for block
transfers is currently put on the stack.

A branch can be found here:

And big kudos to Renesas Electronics for funding this work, thank you very much!

Regards,

   Wolfram
