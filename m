The short of it is that this is *not* described by
"arm,armv7-timer-mem".

Given that this has the CNTCR and CNTFID0 registers, this is the
"counter module". This is not described by the "arm,armv7-timer-mem"
binding.

This is only expected to be of use to boot FW, and the counter module is
liable to be secure only, so this isn't something we want in that
binding, and I am not keen on adding a new binding for it.

For more details, take a look at ARM DDI 0406C.c, D5.2 "Memory-mapped
counter module" on page D5-2399.

CNTFID<0..n> are ID registers, each describing a frequency that the
counter supports. These may be RO or RW. If the latter, some early
bringup software is expected to fill them in so that subsequent users
see sane values.

These are *not* control registers, and writing to them should have no
affect other than changing the value read back from them.

Note that CNTCR.FCREQ is expected to be programmed with the index of the
desired frequency (resetting to 0).

We expect FW to configure CNTFRQ along with the rest of the boot-time
generic timer initialisation which can only be done from the secure
side.

I'm hesitant to expose a helper that makes it look like this is a
sensible thing to do in the kernel, so I'm not keen on a geneic
arch_timer_set_cntfrq() helper.

The clock-frequency property is also a bodge, and is problemaic for
virtualisation, or in the presence of userspace timer access.

If you can't fix the FW, it would be much nicer to have a
platform-specific bootloader shim set this all up prior to entering the
kernel.

Thanks,
Mark.
