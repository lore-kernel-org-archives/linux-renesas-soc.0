I do not feel myself experienced I2C developer, so please be merciful if
I write stupid things :)

>From what I see the whole recovery infrastructure partially duplicates
i2c_bit_algo/i2c_algo_bit_data algorithm, and GPIO recovery duplicates
i2c-gpio driver.
Wouldn't be better to somehow reuse existing code? For example by adding
recovery callback in i2c_algorithm, and call i2c-gpio::recovery or
i2c_bit_algo::recovery from rcar-i2c-recovery (in this particular case).

I am not sure how much work it requires, and if it is worth it. Please
consider it as suggestion.
