Hi,

Thanks for report!

Damn it, although I couldn't find this in the code, but I was fearing
that this ends up in atomic section. That would kind of explain why
mutex was not there [1].

Anyway, the buggy code was there already. Instead of "sleeping in atomic
section" there was no locking at all... In this context this was
probably safe because it was executed *after* disabling non-boot CPUs
but then the function cannot be called in other contexts.

I am not sure I will be capable of developing the proper fix as I do not
have the hardware and I do not know all stuff happening in sh suspend.
Probably reverting this and living with non-locked path would be the
safest choice.
