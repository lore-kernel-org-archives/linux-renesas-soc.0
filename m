Many thanks for taking the time for this long background information!

Please note that I don't doubt any of the design choices done.

I think I just want to discuss if we have a clever idea to further 
improve one detail. That is, if we have a clever idea to avoid the copy 
& paste between the family members using anything like a hierarchical 
way of defining the clocks in r8a779x-cpg-mssr.h.

Well, regarding the r8a779x-cpg-mssr.h the small amount of work needed 
isn't a really good argument if you are good with cp & sed for the copy 
& paste done ;)


What I fear we end up the way we are doing the copy & paste 
r8a779x-cpg-mssr.h is having 5 or 6 or even more of these files, all > 
90% identical. And once you have to change anything, you either have to 
change all these files. Or you miss anything, ending up with subtle bugs 
when one SoC does behave differently than an other one.


Best regards

Dirk
