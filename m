Subject: [PATCH v2 1/2] ARM: dts: r8a7793: add CAN clocks to device tree
Date: Wed, 16 Mar 2016 10:52:55 +0900
Message-Id: <1458093176-1926-2-git-send-email-horms+renesas@verge.net.au>
In-Reply-To: <1458093176-1926-1-git-send-email-horms+renesas@verge.net.au>
References: <1458093176-1926-1-git-send-email-horms+renesas@verge.net.au>
List-ID: <linux-renesas-soc.vger.kernel.org>

The R-Car CAN controllers can derive the CAN bus clock not only from their
peripheral clock input (clkp1) but also from the other internal clock
(clkp2) and external clock fed on CAN_CLK pin. Describe those clocks in
the device tree along with  the USB_EXTAL clock from which clkp2 is
derived.

Based on work by Sergei Shtylyov for the r8a7791 SoC.

v2
* Rebase
* Name clock nodes can and usb_extal
* Do not add clock-output-names property to new nodes
* Add MSTP9 clocks

Notes:
* "rcan" is already present in the clock-output-names property of
  the cpg_clocks node
* R8A7793_CLK_RCAN* are already present in
  include/dt-bindings/clock/r8a7793-clock.h
