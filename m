Marek: I think you misunderstood Wolfram's question.
He asked about the DT bindings, not about the driver.

Wolfram: Eugenu's commit 4f145f14f6b98b5a ("dt-bindings: can:
rcar_can: document r8a77965 support") is in next as of next-20181115 .
However, it's not part of linux-can-next. Seems to be destined for v4.20 as
a fix.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

                        Geert
