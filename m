The standard argument here, is always to have the bootloader patch up
the device tree to make it represent the actual device. We do this all
the time for things such as command line, memory sizes, ethernet
addresses, etc. This is no different.

In this very narrow case maybe, but in general it's a horrible idea to
encourage people to use the command line instead of device tree for
this.

I'm still waiting on a compelling argument to motivate why this patch
should be applied. I don't think there is one, so let's not apply it.
