Subject: [PATCH v3 1/7] dt-bindings: timer: renesas,cmt: Fix SoC-specific compatible values
Date: Mon, 18 Sep 2017 15:46:41 +0200
Message-Id: <1505742407-31576-2-git-send-email-geert+renesas@glider.be>
In-Reply-To: <1505742407-31576-1-git-send-email-geert+renesas@glider.be>
References: <1505742407-31576-1-git-send-email-geert+renesas@glider.be>
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-renesas-soc.vger.kernel.org>

While the new family-specific compatible values introduced by commit
6f54cc1adcc8957f ("devicetree: bindings: R-Car Gen2 CMT0 and CMT1
bindings") use the recommended order "<vendor>,<family>-<device>", the
new SoC-specific compatible values still use the old and deprecated
order "<vendor>,<device>-<soc>".

Switch the SoC-specific compatible values to the recommended order while
there are no upstream users of these compatible values yet.

Fixes: 7f03a0ecfdc786c1 ("devicetree: bindings: r8a73a4 and R-Car Gen2 CMT bindings")
Fixes: 63d9e8ca0dd4bfa4 ("devicetree: bindings: Deprecate property, update example")
