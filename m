Subject: [PATCH v2 16/16] ARM: dts: r8a7794: sort subnodes of root node
Date: Wed, 17 Jan 2018 17:17:17 +0100
Message-Id: <20180117161717.14589-17-horms+renesas@verge.net.au>
In-Reply-To: <20180117161717.14589-1-horms+renesas@verge.net.au>
References: <20180117161717.14589-1-horms+renesas@verge.net.au>
Sender: linux-renesas-soc-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-renesas-soc.vger.kernel.org>

Sort the subnodes of the soc node to improve maintainability.
The sort key is the address on the bus with instances of the same
IP block grouped together.

This patch should not introduce any functional change.
