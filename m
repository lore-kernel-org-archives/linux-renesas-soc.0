Wait... Aren't R8A78000_CPG_SGASYNCD8_PERW_MAIN and
R8A78000_CPG_SGASYNCD8_PERW_BUS the same clock, just with a different
name ? The user manual says _BUS, the clock diagram in the spreadsheet
says _MAIN. The SCP firmware defines both, with the same parent (PLL5)
and the same frequency. I have a feeling it may "just" be discrepancy
between the user manual and the spreadsheets.

Yes, it's not new.

I *think* I like the resulting DT better. As the module standby feature
is now listed in the power-domains property, even if we model it
internally as a clock, it doesn't appear as a clock any more in DT.
Clocks the drivers need have to be listed independently, which decouples
them from the module standby.

On Gen5 we will then end up enabling the clock twice, once through the
power domain, and once through the explicit clk_enable(fck) in the
driver. I suppose that's fine in theory (there's an extra runtime cost
though) as clocks are reference-counted. However, the current SCP
firmware reference-counts the clocks based on their SCMI ID, and the
MDLC clock (perw 0x54) and its parent (R8A78000_CPG_SGASYNCD4_PERW_BUS)
have different IDs. This can cause the clock to be disabled at an
unexpected point. In this specific case, however, given that
R8A78000_CPG_SGASYNCD4_PERW_BUS isn't controllable, it won't cause an
issue, but in the generic case it can fail badly.

Not on Renesas platforms so far. I can imagine this being used to
control for instance the whole VIO hierarchy. Depending on the bandwidth
used by image sensors, system integrators may want to tweak the PLL
frequency.

See above :-)

Future-proofing, to avoid adding the SGASYNCD32 clock later with a
non-consecutive ID.

I think we should also ask for names to be double-checked and fixed in
the next version of the documentation.
