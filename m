Subject: [PATCH v5 00/11] UHS-I SDR-104 support for sh_mobile_sdhi
Date: Tue, 30 Aug 2016 23:09:48 +0200

Hi,

this series is based on work by Ai Kyuse to add UHS-I SDR-104 support for
sh_mobile_sdhi. It builds on work by Shinobu Uehara, Rob Taylor, William
Towle and Ian Molton, Ben Hutchings, Wolfram Sang and others to add UHS-I
SDR-50 support to the same driver.

This series enables:
* UHS-I SDR-104 on the r8a7790/Lager where UHS-I SDR-50 is already enabled.
* Both UHS-1 SDR-50 and SDR-104 on the r8a7796/Salvator-X

It is based on the next branch of the mmc tree

The "mmc:" patches are targeted at the next branch of the mmc
tree. The "ARM:" and "arm64:" patches are targeted at the next branch of
the renesas tree.

To aid review the following git branches have been provided:
* topic/sdr104-v4 branch: This patchset
* topic/sdr104-v5+sdhi-dma-v3: This patchset merged with a rebase of
                               prototype DMA support for SDHI on R-Car Gen 3

Overview of changes since v4:
* Addressed review from Ulf Hansen
* Add Gen 3 support and enable on r8a7796/Salvator-X

TODO:
* Continue investigation of using saved tap values on resume
  from suspend

Please see http://elinux.org/Tests:SD-SDHI-SDR104 for indicative tests
results.
