So the "bus_addr_t" reaction was prompted by the recent activity of
RDMA developers looking to re-use the devm_memremap_pages() api.  That
enabling is looking at how to setup peer-to-peer PCI-E cycles for an
RDMA device to deliver data to another local device without taking a
round trip through host memory.

I understand the history of the dmaengine-slave implementation, but it
seems we're getting to point where we need a less overloaded
identifier than "dma" for the case of devices talking to each other.
