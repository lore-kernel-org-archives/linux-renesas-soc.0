That's fixed...

I think you are right, in fact, see below ...

I think you're right. I should be just getting the clk rate of the fck
and derive the gyroadc timings from that, correct ? I can send a patch
for the driver to just ignore the second clock entry and update the DT
binding document to drop the "if" clock (?) .
