I had not looked at the series earlier, but this version looks entirely
reasonable to me, so

Acked-by: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>


One concern I have is that we might get an awkward situation if we
ever encounter one DMA engine hardware that is used in different
systems that all have an IOMMU, but on some of them the connection
between the DMA master and the slave FIFO bypasses the IOMMU
while on others the IOMMU is required. I don't have any idea for
how this could be handled in a generic way, so my best answer
here is to hope we never get there, and if we do, handle it
using some local hack in the driver.
