Sort of. This patch is just an example to stir up some discussion
about this topic. I realize this code as-is changes R-Car Gen2
behavior (that is merged upstream) so perhaps we should keep devices
enabled for those SoCs.

Right, if I understand correctly then you're saying opt-out might be
better instead of opt-in. In case of IPMMU and R-Car Gen3 I believe it
might be less work to use opt-in rather than excluding not-yet-working
stuff. =)

With this series I would like to propose to disconnect the DT
integration timing from the enablement of IPMMU support for slave
devices. If we can enable the IPMMU in DT early on we can reduce
potential out-of-tree IPMMU enablement DT patches. So with the DT
bindings fixed and accurate data sheet we can merge DT bits ahead of
enablement time. And then use run time logic to determine what to
enable based on test results.

As you are aware, currently we have used the presence of "iommus" in
DT to determine if a device is going to be enabled or not. So if the
IPMMU Kconfig bits enable the IPMMU driver and the "iommus" DT
property tie a certain slave device to the IPMMU then we will make use
of IPMMU for a certain device. Currently we assume it will work on all
ES versions that use that particular DTB.

However ES specific hardware errata together with a wide range of ES
versions for r8a7795 and r8a7796 (and whatever SoCs and ES versions
that comes next) makes it difficult to use DT like above to enable
stuff seemingly on one ES version without potentially breaking other
ES versions. I would like to share DT files between the ES versions as
much as possible but still only enable IPMMU support for devices that
are known to work.

Let me know if you think it makes sense to enable DT in a different
way than my proposal.

I'll have a look at putting the white list code in ->xlate() instead
of ->add_device().

Thanks for your comments!

Cheers,
