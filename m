I just registered and will CC from now on.

Thanks for spotting this.

Hmmmmmm, this doesn't look quite right and it does make the binding
complicated and the MB88101A into quite the special snow flake. Also,
what if you have the MB88101A channels 0 and 1 connected only to ie.
gyroadc channels 2 and 3? What about something like:

adc2: adc@2 {
 reg = <0>;
 compatible = "fujitsu,mb88101a";
 vref-supply = <&vref_fujitsu_mb88101a>;
};

adc3: adc@3 {
 reg = <3>;
 renesas,adc-master = <&adc2>;
};

Fixed all
