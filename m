I guess there are plenty.  Whether a line is shared or dedicated depends
on SoC integration.

The issue is that a driver requesting exclusive access has no way to know
if the reset line is dedicated to its device or not.  If no other
driver requested
the reset control (most drivers don't use reset controls), it will succeed.

So perhaps the check should be done for the existing exclusive resets
instead, without adding a new flag?

Indeed, exclusive has multiple meanings here:
  1. Exclusive vs. shared access to the reset control,
  2. Reset line is dedicated to a single device, or shared with multiple
     devices.

If we can simplify (exclusive == dedicated, 1.shared == 2.shared), life
can become simpler.

I didn't actually check which drivers.
If a reset is not dedicated, device_reset{,_optional}() will suddenly
start to fail if
a reset turns out to be not dedicated.
Well, currently the device will be reset multiple times, so people would
already have noticed...

We already have SoCs where reset lines are shared among multiple on-chip
devices. So dtc validation won't work, and a runtime check is needed.
