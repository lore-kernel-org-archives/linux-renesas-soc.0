When clearing the ICE bit, all registers fall back to their defaut value. That
allows for some simplifications in the code.

Tested on a Renesas Lager board (R-Car H2) doing a bunch of consecutive
commands. No spurious interrupts have been observed and the signals look
exactly the same when visualized with sigrok.

According to the docs, the ICE bit behaviour is the same since the beginning of
this driver (sh7722) for the migo-r board.

jacopo: can you please test this series while you work on migo-r anyhow? Thank
you a ton for that!

Looking forward to other comments, as well...

  i2c: sh_mobile: remove redundant initialization
  i2c: sh_mobile: remove redundant deinitialization
  i2c: sh_mobile: manually "inline" two short functions
  i2c: sh_mobile: use direct writes when accessing ICE bit
  i2c: sh_mobile: shorten exit of xfer routine
