I could successfully move around big files on Lager/H2 and
Salvator-X/M3-W with multiple cards. The md5sum of the files matched.

The transfer speedups match Simon's numbers.

On M3-W, one card has problems because it wants to retune and that
causes problems independently of this DMA driver. M3-W works fine with
other cards. The card in question works fine with H2.
