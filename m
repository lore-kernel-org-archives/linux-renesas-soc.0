I had second thoughts and I think you're right: pwm_apply_args()
should set the pargs.period period for us.

Here is a patch addressing that.

Geert, can you test it?

Subject: [PATCH] pwm: Fix pwm_apply_args()

Commit 5ec803edcb70 ("pwm: Add core infrastructure to allow atomic
updates"), implemented pwm_disable() as a wrapper around
pwm_apply_state(), and then, commit ef2bf4997f7d ("pwm: Improve args
checking in pwm_apply_state()") added missing checks on the ->period
value in pwm_apply_state() to ensure we were not passing inappropriate
values to the ->config() or ->apply() methods.

The conjunction of these 2 commits led to a case where pwm_disable()
was no longer succeeding, thus preventing the polarity setting done
in pwm_apply_args().

Set a valid period in pwm_apply_args() to ensure polarity setting
won't be rejected.
