Subject: [PATCH] i2c: i2c-mux: Fix channel parent node assignment

I2c-mux channels are created with the mux parent device as their own
parent, while they should be siblings of the mux itself.
Fix this.

Hello,
   while inspecting child nodes of an i2c adapter it has been noted that
child devices of an i2c-mux are listed as children of the i2c adapter itself,
and not of the i2c-mux.

The hierarchy of devices looked like

-- i2c-04
--- eeprom@57
--- video_receiver@70
--- video_receiver@34
--- gmsl-deserializer@0		<-- MUX
--- gmsl-deserializer@0/i2c@0	<-- MUX CHANNEL

It now looks like

-- i2c-04
--- eeprom@57
--- video_receiver@70
--- video_receiver@34
--- gmsl-deserializer@0
---- gmsl-deserializer@0/i2c@0
