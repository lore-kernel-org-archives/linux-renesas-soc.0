I mean in DT, i.e.:

        pinctrl: pin-controller@fcfe3000 {
                compatible = "renesas,r7s72101-ports", "renesas,r7s72100-ports";
                ...

That way you don't have to extend the pinctrl driver.

If RZ/A1H and RZ/A1M differ in the amount of RAM only, I think you can
just consider them the same, though, and use the same DTS (assumed
the boot loader fills/corrects in the memory node).
