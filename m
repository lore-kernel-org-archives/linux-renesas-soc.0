Upon closer look, the SoC-specific controls are also used to control compilation
of the SYSC (power domain) tables,  each consuming a few 100 bytes.
So either they become user-visible, too, or always compiled in (depending
on SoC family?).

I've just noticed Tegra also has SoC-specific controls, but they're located
in drivers/soc/tegra/Kconfig, not the main arch/arm64/Kconfig.platforms.
Do you consider that a viable alternative?

Thanks again!
