We should stop allowing that or at least require that anyone using
i2c-gpio have flags. If they are added this new i2c-gpio binding, then
they can add flags too.

In theory yes, but reality is pretty much everyone follows it. There's
no other way to specify active high vs. low for example. Furthermore,
if someone wanted to do flags in their own custom way, that would
still work. It is still the controller (or GPIO core) that interprets
the flags, not the client.

This is a new binding, so only new DT will have it and we can apply
new standards.
