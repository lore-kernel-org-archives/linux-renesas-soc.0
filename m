That simplifies DT and will give more flexibility to handle all the weird 
details in C code, so I like it.

Additionally the amount of per-SoC data related to power domains is pretty 
limited, so we shouldn't have a size issue, even for multi-platform kernels. 
The removal of DT parsing code might even make the kernel smaller. The only 
driver I'm concerned about when it comes to per-SoC data size is the PFC 
driver.
