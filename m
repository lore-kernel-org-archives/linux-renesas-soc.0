Yes judging from other Gen3 boards which al be it is using the gen3 
thermal driver the temperature seems to be in range of what is observed 
there in idle where the 3 different zones on those H3 for example is 
between 38C - 42C.

But I have no method of observing the real temperature other then with 
the driver that is being under test. And then tests i do is to 
increasing the CPU load in order to generate heat and observe the 
temperature increasing. But 40C seems like a reasonable value during 
idle compared to other Gen3 SoCs I looked at.
