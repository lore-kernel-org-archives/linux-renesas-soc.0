Oh, so we can have both groups names, and be compatible?

SEL_CANFD0 switches between the A and B groups for CANFD0_TX, CANFD0_RX,
and CANFD0_CLK together.
So all three pins must use either group A, or group B. That's something the
user must do correctly anyway.

However, the CANFD_CLK pin is shared between the CANFD0 and CANFD1
modules.  So a user who uses CANFD1, and not CANFD0, still has to configure
pinmuxing for CANFD_CLK.

Same story: SCIF_CLK is shared by the HSCIFx and SCIFx modules.
Still puts the responsability in the hands of the board designer: he must
know not to select SCIF_CLK_A and HSCIF0_B, or SCIF_CLK_B and HSCIF0_A.

On this SoC, the limitations seem to be worse than on other members of
the same family.

However, on other SoCs you have similar limitations. E.g. on H3/M3-W/M3-N
you cannot select scif5_data_a and scif5_clk_b, as they are both controlled
through sel_scif5, although the driver has them in separate groups.
But that is done to allow using only RX/TX functionality, and using the
CTS/RTS pins for something else (a completely different function, or GPIO).
