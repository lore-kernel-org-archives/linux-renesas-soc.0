In the hardware manual, look at "Table 54.4 PPRnm Read Values"

When PM_REG is '0', the input buffer value (PIBC_REG) is don't care (X)

I admit, I didn't really look at the suggested flow that the manual said.
I just want off the fact that PMC_REG was the last thing being set, so all
the other registers were irrelevant until that point.

However, you can change the order if you like, as longs as the register
settings still end up the same way as I outlined.

Yes, my suggestion is to make BIDIR and SWIO_[IN|OUT] exclusive in the DT. =
You
only choose one (or nothing). You can specify that in the DT bindings docum=
ent.

There should not be case. Actually...when I went through this, I think the =
HW manual
prohibits this anyway...or rather one cancels the other....but I can't reme=
mber which.
But, I did spend a good amount of time re-reading the chapter when I was re=
viewing
your code.


Thank you,
Chris
