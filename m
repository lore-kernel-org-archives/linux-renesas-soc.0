Hi Robin,

Thanks for your feedback!

=)

Sure, I agree with you!

Please note that this is currently a mix of software and hardware
policy. On R-Car Gen2 (ARM32) the legacy code only uses a single
context for now but 4 contexts are supported by hardware according to
the data sheet. The remaining 3 contexts are untested at this point.
For R-Car Gen3 (ARM64) the hardware supports 8 contexts and this patch
enables all of them.

So you mean that in case of test_and_set_bit() returns 1 then we try
find_first_zero_bit() again?

This is not really a performance sensitive part of the driver, so I'm
currently optimizing for code readability. I'm of course all for
dropping the lock, but I have a hard time figuring out how your
suggestion could result in semi-readable code. Any pointers? =)

Sure, I agree. Will drop.
