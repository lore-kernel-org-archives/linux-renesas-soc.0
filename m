Yeah, but those doesn't normally use it to toggle the setting, but
instead only to set a default value during ->probe() or whatever
initialization code that runs.

I think that makes a big difference, doesn't it?

I see! So, in the end this seems like a combination of what the HW
supports and what the user policy is set to.

Out of curiosity, can you tell how those Renesas Ethernet devices
works in this regards?

Anyway, thanks for clarifying!

Kind regards
