OK.

No, according to Figures 5.1 and 5.3, the CA9 is connected to both the
North and South main buses.

OK.

Given I've added "arm,shared-override" in the past, I'd say yes ;-)

According to the "CoreLink Level 2 Cache Controller L2C-310" TRM,
"no sideband signals" is even the default configuration?
