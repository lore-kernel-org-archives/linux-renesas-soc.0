Subject: [PATCH v2 0/7] R-Car M3-N DTS fixes

Hello,
   in this second iteration I have fixed two remarks from Geert received on
v1:
- Extend "du" address length to include third channel
- Move usb2_phy1 device node next to usb2_phy0

Two minor nits were not addressed:
- "placeholder" comment position not changed to maintain consistency with
  placeholders in M3-W. When they'll get changed, let's change all of them at
  the same time.
- The addresses block sizes (and multiple address range blocks) are still there
  (next time we can consider dropping the unit address from place-holder nodes
  and do not add any "reg" property at all, until DTC won't start complaining
  about this as well)

All patches but the newly introduced 7/7 now have Geert's Reviewed-by tag.

Simon: as per v1, this series is based on my M3-N enablement series, last
patch on Ether-AVB excluded.

Thanks
   j

v1 -> v2:
