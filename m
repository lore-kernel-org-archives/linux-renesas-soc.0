In the case of Renesas R-Car hardware we know that there are generations of
SoCs, e.g. Gen 1 and Gen 2, but beyond that its not clear what the
relationship between IP blocks might be. For example, I believe that
r8a7779 is older than r8a7778 but that doesn't imply that the
latter is a descendant of the former or vice versa.
