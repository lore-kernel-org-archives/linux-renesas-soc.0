Subject: [PATCH v2 0/2] ARM: dts: r8a7793: add CAN to device tree

Hi,

this short series adds CAN clocks and nodes to the r8a7794 device tree.

I am not aware of an r8a7794 board that exposes CAN - neither the alt nor
the silk board appear to - and thus am unsure of a way to test these
changes.  However, they are based on what is present for the r8a7791 SoC
and I am unable to find a difference in the SoC documentation.

This series is similar to a similar series I posted for the r8a7794
in January.

Based on renesas-devel-20160311-v4.5-rc7.

Changes in v2
* Correct clock node names
* Add MSTP9 clocks
* Omit clock-output-names property from new nodes
