And note that it shouldn't be skipped by pm_runtime_force_resume() in
principle, because there are active children under usb-phy.

It is there, because usb-phy itself is now reference-counted by the
phy layer, so its usage counter is greater than 1 in
genpd_finish_suspend() and its parent's children counter is not
decremented then.

Next, on resume, the pm_runtime_force_resume() in genpd_resume_noirq()
will attempt to resume both usb-phy and its parent via
genpd_runtime_suspend() and that (again) is too early.

I'm not sure, however, why the crash isn't there with
https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-renesas-soc/msg21719.html alone,
because in theory it should be there too in that case.

Thanks,
Rafael
