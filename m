Subject: [PATCH RFT] mmc: core: use usleep_range rather than HZ magic in mmc_delay()
Date: Tue, 14 Nov 2017 23:55:20 +0100
Message-Id: <20171114225520.6793-1-wsa+renesas@sang-engineering.com>
Sender: linux-renesas-soc-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-renesas-soc.vger.kernel.org>

Documentation/timers/timers-howto.txt recommends to use usleep_range for
delays 1-20ms. Let's adhere to it. No need for messing with HZ and still
do busy looping these days.

Here is a more detailed test page for this describing my tests:

https://elinux.org/Tests:mmc-delay-refactor

I did mainly test the insert/eject cycle because powering up the cards
seemed to trigger most delays. Transferring data did not cause any calls
to mmc_delay() for me. Please let me know if someone knows a test pattern
which should be included before applying this change.

Works fine for me on Lager (R-Car H2) and Salvator-X (R-Car M3-W). Testing on
other platforms very welcome. This should be independent of the IP core.
