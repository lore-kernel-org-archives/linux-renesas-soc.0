The fsl-mc is actually a sort-of-bus-controller probing and configuring
its (directly DMA-capable) child devices, so is in fact legitimate here.

That one is completely bogus, and should just go away.

That one is part of some ugly trickery involving creating a fake device
to represent multiple separate IOMMU devices. The driver could probably
be reworked to not need it (the Exynos IOMMU handles a similar situation
without such tricks), but it's non-trivial.
