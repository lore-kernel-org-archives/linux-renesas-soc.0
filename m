Hi Olof, Hi Kevin, Hi Arnd,

Please consider these Renesas ARM based SoC DT updates for v4.19.


The following changes since commit ce397d215ccd07b8ae3f71db689aedb85d56ab40:

  Linux 4.18-rc1 (2018-06-17 08:04:49 +0900)

  ARM: dts: r8a77470: Use r8a77470-cpg-mssr binding definitions (2018-07-18 10:47:01 +0200)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Renesas ARM Based SoC DT Updates for v4.19

* RZ/G1C (r8a77470) SoC

  Use r8a77470-cpg-mssr binding definitions, which are now available in
  mainline, instead of numeric indices.

* Add GR-Peach audio camera shield support with MT9V111 image sensor

  This allows use of this shield with the RZ/A1 (r7s72100) SoC based
  GR-Peach board.

* Add initial support for RZ/N1D (r9a06g032) SoC and its RZN1D-DB board

* Use SPDX identifiers in DT for all SoCs and boards

* Add missing OPP properties for all CPUs on various SoCs

  This fixes SoCs where OPP properties were only defined for CPU0
  which allows correct operation regardless of the order in which
  CPUs are brought up.

* Drop MTD partitioning from DT

  This does not describe HW and providing partitioning on the kernel
  command line provides a more flexible solution.

* Add missing PMIC nodes to R-Car Gen2 M2-W (r8a7791) based porter board

  This describes the two PMIC devices present on the porter and
  connects CPU DVS supply.
