For historical reasons the mixer settings required to get functional sound
have been documented in DT files. The above is in keeping with that.

Personally I find this quite helpful but I think it would be at least as
helpful documented on elinux.org or somewhere similar. So I would not
object to it being omitted from here and consideration given to removing it
from other Renesas DT files.
