As you said in your other email, it's not the same.

Other than #address-cells already having another defined purpose in
/cpus, my guess is 64-bit works for either and 32-bit SMP systems
didn't predate 64-bit (for the ePAPR author's perspective).

I would have thought that followed #{size,address}-cells being
/memory. Though, I guess the bootloader fills this in and it is much
easier to work with fixed sizes.
