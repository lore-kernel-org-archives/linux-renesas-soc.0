Subject: [RFT] mmc: tmio: fix CMD12 (STOP) handling
Date: Mon,  3 Jul 2017 21:28:23 +0200

I always anticipated this code to be not correct, but now I had a test
case to prove it. According to all documentation I have, setting the
TMIO_STOP_STP bit ever only worked during block transfers. This bit is
like manually enforcing an autocmd12 during a so far seamless transfer.
It does NOT work when the block transfer had errors. It also does NOT
work with any other cmd except block commands. For all those, CMD12 has
to be treated like any other command. So, basically, we could use this
bit only for mrq->data->stop cmds. But for these, we happily use the
autocmd12 feature using the TMIO_STOP_SEC bit. As a result, the above
bit is not useful for us and we need to treat CMD12 as a regular cmd
always. Just remove the special handling code. Note that the BSP
recognized this issue as well yet had a more cautious solution to the
problem [1]. Which is understandable but makes CMD12 handling even more
complicated.

Checked with a Renesas Salvator-X/M3-W which needed to send CMD12 when
retuning one of my SD cards.

So, this is a friendly call for further testing to make sure no regressions
happen. I also put the authors of the BSP patch to CC to check if this patch
also matches their use case. I hope this is fine for these people, please
accept my apologies if not. I just really like to have your opinion on this
patch.

Geert, Simon: any chance you can run this patch on your board farms?

In any case: as far as my understanding goes, if I am wrong with my
assumptions, the worst case is that for older SoCs CMD12 handling might become
a tad more inefficient because we now do in software what was expected to be
done in hardware. However, I am quite sure that the HW feature was always
over-estimated and CMD12 support is simply broken. For my test case and the BSP
patch above, it definately was.

Thanks for any assistance,

   Wolfram
