This is exactly what shall happen :-)

If the mmc core suspends the card, it means it will also re-initialize
the card when resuming it. In that way the regular tuning sequence
will take place as a part of re-initialization of the card, so you
definitely must not restore tap values in these case. That is why you
should be using the can_retune to know when to restore the values.

It shouldn't be that hard to implement this, so I rather see that we
get this right from the beginning.

As matter of fact it probably requires less code than you had in your
initial approach, especially since I don't think you need to deal with
anything tuning related in the ->runtime_suspend() callback, but only
in ->runtime_resume().

Kind regards
