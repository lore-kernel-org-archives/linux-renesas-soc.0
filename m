Sorry, I meant "would not requite DT properties".

If a display controller uses OF graph then the panel DT node has to declare 
ports. If the display controller doesn't use OF graph but instead expects the 
panel to be a direct subnode, or points to the panel using a property such as 
fsl,panel, then the panel DT node will not have ports.

Thank you. Can I get your ack then ? :-)
