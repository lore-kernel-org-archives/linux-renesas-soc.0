Presumably you can always figure out what the rate of the clk is,
or at least return the rate of the parent clk if it can't be
figured out for some odd reason. In this case it looks like we
don't have some divider mapping? Why not make it a WARN_ON() and
return 0? Then we can fix the warning by adding the appropriate
mapping in the table and not return some really large frequency.

This also works. I'm dropping this patch from my queue for now.
