Yes there is.  The need to stay enabled during system suspend depends
on the consumer of the interrupt. It is controlled by the consumer using
the irq_chip.irq_set_wake() callback at runtime, and may change at runtime.

If the wakeup_path flag is always set, the interrupt controller will
never be suspended during system suspend, and thus waste power.
