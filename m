So you expect drivers to fall back to PIO automatically if the buffer is
not DMA safe.  Sounds good to me.

However, your check for a DMA-capable buffer is invoked only if
CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG is enabled:

    #if !defined(CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG)
           if (!virt_addr_valid(msg->buf) || object_is_on_stack(msg->buf)) {
                   pr_debug("msg buffer to 0x%04x might not be DMA capable\n",
                            msg->addr);
                   return -EFAULT;
           }
    #endif

So the system will work fine if CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG is enabled, and may fail
miserably in a production kernel?

Furthermore, pr_debug() messages are not printed by default, so the developer
who did enable CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG may not have noticed at all?

If you want to use i2c_check_msg_for_dma() as a generic helper to verify DMA
requirements, and decide when to fall back to PIO, I think it should always do
the buffer check.
