I think we always assumed that the lack of a dma-ranges property
implied a 32-bit width, as that is the safe fallback as well as the
most common case.

AFAICT, this means you are actually fine on rcar, and all other
platforms will keep working as we enforce it, but might get slowed
down if they relied on the unintended behavior of allowing 64-bit
DMA.
