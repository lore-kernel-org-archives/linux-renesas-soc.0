I am not sure if we have such selective configuration of wakeup source
implemented in Linux.

ACPI specification has some provisions where each device can state if it
can specify device state in each system sleeping state that can wake the
system.

DT has no mechanism today to express this relations. I had brought up
this discussion in plumbers(2015). Refer slide 7 in [0]

And the way you are trying to do that is not correct IMO especially
making it just PSCI specific.

IIUC, it's not implemented today. I can't talk about future ;), but your
proposal is horrible hack.
