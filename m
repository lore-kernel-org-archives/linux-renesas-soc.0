Subject: [PATCH 0/4] arm64: renesas: Add support for Salvator-XS

	Hi Simon, Magnus,

The Renesas Salvator-XS (Salvator-X 2nd version) development board can
be equipped with either an R-Car H3 ES2.0 or M3-W ES1.x SiP, which are
pin-compatible.

This patch series adds initial support for the Renesas Salvator-XS
development board equipped with an R-Car H3 ES2.0 SiP.  The support
level is similar to the existing support for Salvator-X with the same
SiP.  See below for exceptions.

The Salvator-XS board is similar but not identical to the already
supported Salvator-X board.  To avoid duplication, the common parts are
extracted first into its own .dtsi file.
Noteworthy differences are:
  - The main clock crystal ticks at a slightly different rate.
  - On R-Car H3 ES2.0, SATA no longer uses dedicated pins, but shares
    them with the second PCIe channel.  To cater for this, a MAX4888B
    multiplexer has been added to Salvator-XS.  As the default hardware
    configuration enables PCIe, I disabled SATA.
  - The Versaclock5 clock generator has been replaced by a similar
    member of the Versaclock6 family.  As the latter is not supported by
    Linux yet, I left it out.
  - The USB3.0 micro-B connector is replaced by a USB2.0 micro-AB
    connector (both are not yet supported, so no change is needed now).

Dependencies:
  - renesas-devel-20170608-v4.12-rc4,
  - "arm64: dts: salvator-x: Add missing index to PWM pinctrl subnode
    name".

For your convenience, I've pushed this series, its dependencies, and a
few related driver changes to the topic/r8a7795-salvator-xs branch of
the git repository at
https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/geert/renesas-drivers.git

This has been tested on Salvator-XS with R-Car H3 ES2.0, and Salvator-X
with R-Car H3 ES1.0.

Thanks!
