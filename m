Subject: [PATCH RFC] HACK: mmc: core: also abort tuning with CMD12 for SD
Date:   Tue, 31 Aug 2021 15:33:49 +0200

We have various SanDisk cards which fail tuning to SDR104 unless we
allow a CMD12 also to be sent to abort a broken tuning. It is true that
the SD specs do not mention that CMD12 is allowed, but they also don't
say it is forbidden. And now reality tells that it is needed to make
some cards work. Other cards I tried did not regress.

If we can agree to allow this for SD, then the problem is now SDIO which
does not support CMD12. mmc_card_sdio() does not work at this stage
because host->card is still NULL. Is there any other way to distinguish
SD and SDIO here?

Hey guys,

so, there are two questions here:
1) despite not being mentioned in the spec, do we want to allow CMD12 to
   abort tuning for SD as well?

2) If so, how to make sure not apply it to SDIO but SD only?

Thanks for your input! Kind regards,

   Wolfram
