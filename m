Subject: [PATCH 04/31] ARM: dts: lager: rename and reindex i2cexio
Date: Wed, 23 Nov 2016 21:14:11 +0100
Message-Id: <1e26fcf31c5c70557689184185913881e4557bc0.1479931686.git.horms+renesas@verge.net.au>

The rename from i2cexio to i2cexio0 is in preparation for adding
i2cexio1 which will use the demuxer for IIC1/I2C1.

The reindexing from i2c8 to i2c10 is to allow space for grouping of
additional GPIO buses to be added by follow-up patches to support demuxing
of other i2c buses.

Also note that fallback to GPIO is not provided by the hardware for IIC0/I2C0.
