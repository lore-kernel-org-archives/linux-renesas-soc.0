Below code is tested on X-Gene system which supports 1 interrupt per
GPIO on Port A. You can update it into your patch.

-               if (has_acpi_companion(dev) && pp->idx =3D=3D 0)
-                       pp->irq =3D platform_get_irq(to_platform_device(dev=
), 0);
+               if (has_acpi_companion(dev) && pp->idx =3D=3D 0) {
+                       unsigned int j;
+                       for (j =3D 0; j < pp->ngpio; j++) {
+                               pp->irq[j] =3D
platform_get_irq(to_platform_device(dev), j);
+                               if (pp->irq[j])
+                                       pp->has_irq =3D true;
+                       }
+               }
