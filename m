That's correct. Interrupts are not part of the parent/child relationship.
Traditionally, irqchips were not platform devices, but now many irqchips
used on embedded platforms are.

Correct.

GPIOs used for wake-up? E.g. SDHI GPIO. We don't seem to have that
enabled for the Renesas SDHI drivers, though.

For gpio-keys, this is handled through enable_irq_wake(), so again it
uses an irqchip.

Correct.

OK.

Yes.

IMHO this is orthogonal to the device: the device driver knows if the
device itself is generating the wake-up event (e.g. Wake-on-LAN, dedicated
SDHI CD), or some other device is taking care (e.g. GPIO SDHI CD).
The device driver may not know if the device needs to be kept awake to
to handle wake-up events, that may be platform knowledge handled by genpd.

Oops, inverted logic. I should not write technical emails on Sunday morning.

Yes, the device must be kept awake if either IN_BAND_WAKEUP is set, or
if GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP is set but OUT_BAND_WAKEUP isn't.
