Preliminary testing shows that I2C pin muxing works. Nice job!

Testing:
- RZ/A1H RSK board
- u-boot modified to make sure pins are put back to GPIO-IN
- RIIC ch3 is connected to a I2C port expander that has 3 LEDs attached
- using a heartbeat kernel thread that blinks the LEDs

Of course, more testing is needed to make sure there is no "smoke and mirro=
rs"
going on like there was with the MSTP clock driver ;)


Note that the I2C pin need to be configured at "bi-directional" but there i=
s
no way to specify that from DT, so that has to be added as a parameter.

I am very happy about how easy it is to set the pins up! It almost matches
what I do in our BSP code today, so I didn't even have to look at the HW sc=
hematic.

I'll give Ethernet and SDHI a try. For RSPI, I have to go manually wire up =
a
SPI flash again.
