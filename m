Subject: [PATCH 0/5] arm64: dts: r8a779[56]: salvator-x: Add I2C for DVFS device support

Hi,

this series enables I2C for DVFS  on the salvator-x board for the
r8a7795 and r8a7796 SoCs.

Base:
* This series is based on renesas-next-20170126-v4.10-rc2

Dependencies:
* This series has a run-time dependency on
  "[PATCH 0/2] clk: renesas: r8a7795/r8a7796: Add IIC-DVFS clock"
* This series has a check patch dependency on
  "[PATCH i2c/for-next] i2c: sh_mobile: document support for r8a7796 (R-Car M3-W)"
* This series should be safe to apply independently of the above dependencies
