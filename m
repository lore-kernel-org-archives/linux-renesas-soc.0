It won't make much of a difference, as typically you'll want the GIC running
all the time anyway, also for wake-up sources.
We just have to make sure it's not disabled indefinitely.

As such it's different from a real critical clock that kills the system
immediately (e.g. some secret core clock): you can disable the GIC clock,
just make sure to enable it again (and have a means to re-enable it, without
relying on interrupts ;-)

The only difference with a real critical clock is that you

Good, we can convert back later, perhaps when the GIC driver is ready to
support PM for non-secondary GICs...
