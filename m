        Hi Magnus, Mar[ck], Simon,

We're (finally) getting close to the point where Renesas R-Car Gen2
platform code no longer relies on hardcoded addresses.

The remaining parts are related to the ARM Architecture Timer / Generic
Timer / Generic Counter.  More specifically the code in
rcar_gen2_timer_init() in arch/arm/mach-shmobile/setup-rcar-gen2.c,
quoted below.  According to historical information, the issues being
solved here are (1) non-running timers, and (2) wrong frequencies,
leading to (m)sleep() not sleeping for the expected period.
But it's far from clear to me what's really going on...

I believe this region corresponds to the Generic Counter, which is not
the same, but related to the Architecture timer?
It seems no DT bindings exist for the Generic Counter?

(for a moment I thought this might correspond to "arm,armv7-timer-mem", but
 I no longer believe that's true)

On all SoC/board combos I checked (r8a7790/lager, r8a7791/koelsch,
r8a7791/porter, r8a7792/blanche, r8a7793/gose, r8a7794/alt), both
conditions are true, i.e.
  - The timer (counter?) is not running,
  - The configured frequency is 13 MHz, which is wrong.

>           /* Update registers with correct frequency */
>           iowrite32(freq, base + CNTFID0);

This doesn't seem to be needed?
With or without, both msleep() (kernel) and sleep() (userspace) sleep
for the expected amount of time.

>           asm volatile("mcr p15, 0, %0, c14, c0, 0" : : "r" (freq));

This is an open-coded implementation of arch_timer_set_cntfrq(), which
is not provided by arch/arm/include/asm/arch_timer.h (should it?).
Without this, the arch_timer driver complains:

    arch_timer: frequency not available

leading to failures (e.g. division by zero) later.

However, adding the proper "clock-frequency" property to the
"arm,armv7-timer" device node in DT fixes that.
Probably adding this property is a better way to work around broken(?)
firmware not setting CNTFRQ, than checking the SoC type and using
hardcoded values in platform code?

This is definitely needed.  Else the timer doesn't run.

Thanks for your time!
