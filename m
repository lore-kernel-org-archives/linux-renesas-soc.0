Subject: [PATCH v2 0/4] ARM: dts: r8a7790: lager: use demuxer for I2C
Date: Wed,  8 Jun 2016 16:14:22 +0900

Hi,

the intention of this series is to extend use of the demuxer for I2C
on the lager/r8a7790 to cover all I2C IP blocks.

* This is based on work by Wolfram Sang.
* Testing is discussed below
* This series is based on renesas-devel-20160530-v4.7-rc1.
* To aid review it is provided in git at:
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/horms/renesas.git topic/i2c-demux-v2 
* I also intend to add demux for I2C to other R-Car Gen2 boards as a follow-up.

Changes since v1
* Provide GPIO fallback for I2C2,
  this does not seem appropriate for other I2C blocks on the lager board

Discussion of Testing
=====================

My test case iterates through each available master of each demux that
is available and tries to select the masters in reverse. All relevant
drivers are present as per the shmobile_defconfig. The test fails when
the first error occurs. If there are no errors, that is all masters can
be initialises for all demuxes then the test passes.

My test script, which implements the above, is as follows:

--- begin ---
#!/bin/sh

set -e

cd /sys/devices/platform/

sleep 5 

for i in i2c-*; do
        [ "$i" != 'i2c-*' ] || break
        [ -e "$i/current_master" -a -e "$i/available_masters" ] || continue
        echo "I2C Demux: $i"
        for j in $(< "$i/available_masters" tr ' ' '\n' | tac); do
                idx=${j%:*}
                echo "  Master: $j ($idx)"
                echo "$idx" > "$i/current_master"
                sleep 5
        done
done
--- end ---


Results
-------

1. With no patches applied - that is only the demux for I2C0 present -
   the test passes. Excellent!

   # .  /exercise-i2c-demux.sh
   I2C Demux: i2c-8
     Master: 1:/i2c@e6508000 (1)
   [   22.532192] i2c-rcar e6508000.i2c: probed
     Master: 0:/i2c@e6500000 (0)
   [   27.549555] i2c-sh_mobile e6500000.i2c: I2C adapter 4, bus speed 100000 Hz

   Unfortunately from there things are a little less rosy.

2. In general it seems that if more than one demux is present then the
   test fails when iterating through the masters for the first demux
   (that of I2C). E.g. with the first two patches of this series applied
   there is a demux present for I2C0 and I2C1 and the test run is as
   follows. Logs are from the kernel, displayed on the system console where
   the test is also run.

   # ./exercise-i2c-demux.sh
   I2C Demux: i2c-8
     Master: 1:/i2c@e650800
   [   97.694487] i2c-rcar e6508000.i2c: probed 0 (1)
     Master: 0:/i2c@e650000
   [  102.706365] i2c-demux-pinctrl i2c-8: failed to setup demux-adapter 0 (-19) 0 (0)

3. With some manual hacks so that only one demux is present in DT the test
   pasts for the I2C0 (as per 1, above) and I2C2 demux.

   For the I2C2 demux the result is as follows:
   # ./exercise-i2c-demux.sh
   I2C Demux: i2c-9
     Master: 1:/i2c@e6518000 (1)
   [   22.430321] i2c-rcar e6518000.i2c: probed
     Master: 0:/i2c@e6510000 (0)
   [   27.447884] i2c-sh_mobile e6510000.i2c: I2C adapter 5, bus speed 100000 Hz

   3.1 Unfortunately it fails for the I2C2 dmux if the GPIO fallback is
       present.

       # ./exercise-i2c-demux.sh
       I2C Demux: i2c-10
         Master: 2:/i2c-11 (2)
       [   22.347864] i2c-gpio i2c-11: using pins 842 (SDA) and 841 (SCL)
       [   22.358210] i2c-demux-pinctrl i2c-10: failed to setup demux-adapter 2 (-19)
       With gpio fallback removed the test passes:

       # ./exercise-i2c-demux.sh
       I2C Demux: i2c-10
         Master: 1:/i2c@e6530000 (1)
       [  120.307738] i2c-rcar e6530000.i2c: probed
       [  120.313186] adv7180 8-0020: chip found @ 0x20 (i2c-demux (master i2c-2))
       [  120.337700] soc-camera-pdrv soc-camera-pdrv.0: Probing soc-camera-pdrv.0
         Master: 0:/i2c@e6520000 (0)
       [  125.359197] i2c-sh_mobile e6520000.i2c: I2C adapter 6, bus speed 100000 Hz
       [  125.367702] adv7180 8-0020: chip found @ 0x20 (i2c-demux (master i2c-6))
       [  125.387803] soc-camera-pdrv soc-camera-pdrv.0: Probing soc-camera-pdrv.0

   3.2 The test also fails for the I2C3 demux but that appears to be due
       to a shortcoming in the voltage regulator code which does not
       appear to like being reinitialised. The kernel complains as follows:
