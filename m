Thanks. Unfortunately my H3 is out of arms length but I can arrange
some testing if it is helpful.

Is one possibility to enable it for the slots listed above that are now
thought to work but not for the other one?

The SDR50 failure on M3-W seems particularly troubling as that
has been enabled in upstream for a while, right?
