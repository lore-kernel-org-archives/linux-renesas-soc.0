Ah, so you mean there are cases when the provider driver calls
pm_runtime_enable() *after* it calls phy_create()/dev_phy_create()
instead of before?

I am not really sure I understand *why* a provider driver wants to do
that though, do you have more details?
I mean, even if the phy core handles runtime PM, additional management
can be done on top in the phy provider, there is nothing preventing
that, but I guess that isn't sufficient?

Kind regards
Uffe
