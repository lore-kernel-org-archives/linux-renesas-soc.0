Subject: [PATCH 13/15] arm: dts: r8a7743: Add missing OPP properties for CPUs
Date: Fri, 25 May 2018 16:01:59 +0530

The OPP properties, like "operating-points", should either be present
for all the CPUs of a cluster or none. If these are present only for a
subset of CPUs of a cluster then things will start falling apart as soon
as the CPUs are brought online in a different order. For example, this
will happen because the operating system looks for such properties in
the CPU node it is trying to bring up, so that it can create an OPP
table.

Add such missing properties.

Fix other missing property (clock latency) as well to make it all
work.
