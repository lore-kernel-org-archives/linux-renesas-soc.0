OK for me.

Changing the print format in the debug prints is probably too much work,
but those matter less than the clock numbers in the DTS.

I was thinking mainly about code size. But you're right, (a) you use XIP
(with plenty of FLASH?), and (b) RAM size should be similar for a combined
and a separate driver.
