Hmm, this isn't super obvious how to best fix. On one hand, the
pwm_config() API used to reject period<=0, but on the other hand, I
think its replacement (pwm_apply_state()) is getting used in more places
than it used to be, and not all of them are really handling the "atomic
update" concept yet. Seems like a product of Boris's multi-phase attempt
to convert the PWM APIs to support atomic updates -- and many users
haven't really converted yet.

I'm not sure I 100% understand this debug log, but I think maybe the
problem is in pwm_apply_args(), which calls pwm_disable() and
pwm_set_polarity() sequentially, without ever configuring a period? What
if pwm_apply_args() were to configure the period for us?

Boris, any thoughts?

Sorry for the regression :(
