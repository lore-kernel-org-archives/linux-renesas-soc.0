Yes, this is my understanding as well. Is the H3 a superset? And the 
M3-W drops some clocks? Or are there really clocks which are on M3-W 
only and not on H3?

Sounds like this is a nice additional argument to don't do all this copy 
& paste and have a common rcar3.dtsi, instead :)

Ok, then there should be the option to find a clever way to define the 
clocks common on all SoCs only once. And the clocks which are different 
somehow on top, then.

To take the example from

http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.renesas-soc/4013

this

&scif2 {
	clocks = <&cpg CPG_MOD 310>,
		 <&cpg CPG_CORE R8A7795_CLK_S3D1>,
		 <&scif_clk>;
};

&scif2 {
	clocks = <&cpg CPG_MOD 310>,
		 <&cpg CPG_CORE R8A7796_CLK_S3D1>,
		 <&scif_clk>;
};

should be done better.

Best regards

Dirk
