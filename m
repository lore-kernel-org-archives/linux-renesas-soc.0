    No. My problem with resume is I can't wake up the remote system. I don't 
see the needed 'wakeup' file in /sys/devices/platform/soc/e6e60000.serial/...
     However, if I enable CONFIG_PM_[ADVANCED_]DEBUG and do

$ echo -n core /sys/.power/pm_test

the system happily wakes up after a small delay (5 s), w/either SMP or UP kernel.

    Sure!
    The only problem I'm seeing (again) is the RCAN clock failing to register:

rcar_gen2_cpg_clocks_init: failed to register cpg_clocks rcan clock (-12)

    I was going to look at it yesterday but (wrongly) thought it somehow cured 
itself... I'll look at it now.

MBR, Sergei
