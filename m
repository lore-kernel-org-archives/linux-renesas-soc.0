Hi,

This series adds support for hardware backed trip point windows. It is
based on top of v4.11-rc1 and is tested on R-Car H3 and M3-W.

The series starts out by fixing three issues (1/7, 2/7, 3/7) that should
have been fixed by me before the initial driver where submitted to
upstream. Sorry for not spotting the issues sooner.

The series then extends the rcar_gen3_thermal driver with hardware
interrupts for trip point windows by implementing the .set_trips()
callback of struct thermal_zone_of_device_ops (4/7, 5/7). It then adds
suspend and resume handlers so that the hardware interrupts are
preserved across suspend/resume cycles (6/7, 7/7).

* Changes since v1
- Added check that at least one TSC is found
- Record number of TSC in private data structure
- Request interrupts separately from TSCs
- Have only one function which controls both IRQ on and off
- Check return value from of_thermal_get_ntrips()
- Fixed spelling in commit messages
- Add Reviewed-by tags

  thermal: rcar_gen3_thermal: add delay in .thermal_init on r8a7796
  thermal: rcar_gen3_thermal: remove unneeded mutex
  thermal: rcar_gen3_thermal: check that TSC exists before memory
    allocation
  thermal: rcar_gen3_thermal: record and check number of TSCs found
  thermal: rcar_gen3_thermal: enable hardware interrupts for trip points
  thermal: rcar_gen3_thermal: store device match data in private
    structure
  thermal: rcar_gen3_thermal: add suspend and resume support
