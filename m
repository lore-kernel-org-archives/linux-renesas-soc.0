As we spoked about at ELC yesterday, I think the genpd specific
callback for dealing with this is not really the proper solution.

Instead I think this should be treated as a generic problem. In
principle I think we need a way for drivers to inform the
middle-layer/genpd about wakeup requirements during system-wide PM.

Allow me to post a patch showing what I had in mind, then we can see
what you think about it.

This makes sense, however I think it's sufficient to make genpd check
the flag, rather than assigning and using the ->active_wakeup()
callback.

That would then make it possible to remove the callback altogether.
Can you do that instead?

Kind regards
