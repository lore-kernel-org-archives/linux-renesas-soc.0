The main motivation for SoC-specific controls is to avoid including pinctrl
and (to a lesser extent) clock tables for unused SoCs.  Each pinctrl driver
consumes a few tens of KiB, each clock driver a few KiB.
If we remove the SoC-specific ARCH_* controls, the user has to configure
both pinctrl and clock driver selections, thus trading one user-visible
symbol for two new user-visible symbols (except for RZ/A and RZ/N,
where the pinctrl symbols are already visible, to allow reducing kernel
size).
Perhaps that is acceptable?

For the smaller parts in drivers/soc/, removing SoC-specific dependencies
may be viable for R-Car and RZ/G Socs, but not for e.g. RZ/A.  The latter
may be used without external RAM, and can run with a few MiB of internal
SRAM, and XIP (with a still out-of-tree patch).
So at least a family-specific dependency is worth to keep.  For now, RZ/A
is arm32 only, though.

Note that on arm64, there are no family-specific Kconfig symbols yet.
We just have ARCH_RENESAS, which is also set on arm32.
So either we introduce e.g. ARCH_RCAR_GEN3 (cfr. ARCH_RCAR_GEN1 and
ARCH_RCAR_GEN2 or arm32), or use "ARCH_RENESAS && ARM64" for e.g. RST_RCAR
in drivers/soc/renesas/Kconfig, which currently depends on all R-Car Gen3
(and RZ/G2) SoCs explicitly.
Choosing the latter option means we may need to migrate to the former option
later, once other families appear (e.g. RZ/A SoCs may start using
Cortex-A53 instead of Cortex-A9 cores).

For the DTB files, I believe we can just remove the dependencies, and
always build all DTBs.

What do you think?
Thanks!

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

                        Geert
