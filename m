So I have compared all AVB/(G)ETHER pin groups on supported SoCs,
to solve the issue for good, hopefully.

EtherAVB:
--------

R-Car Gen2:

  Common (r8a7790/r8a7791/r8a7792/r8a7793/r8a7794) AVB:

    link = { LINK }
    magic = { MAGIC }
    phy_int = { PHY_INT }
    mdio = { MDC, MDIO }
    mii = { COL, CRS, RX_CLK, RXD[0-3], RX_DV, RX_ER, TX_CLK, TXD[0-3],
            TX_EN, TX_ER }
    gmii = { COL, CRS, GTX_CLK, GTXREFCLK, RX_CLK, RXD[0-7], RX_DV, RX_ER,
             TX_CLK, TXD[0-7], TX_EN, TX_ER }

  AVB exceptions:
    - r8a7790 "mii" lacks TX_ER (should it?)
    - r8a7792 has match = { AVTP_MATCH }


R-Car Gen3:

  r8a7795/r8a7795-es1/r8a7796/r8a77965/r8a77995 AVB:

    link = { LINK }
    magic = { MAGIC }
    phy_int = { PHY_INT }
    mdc = { MDC, MDIO }
    mii = { RD[0-3], RXC, RX_CTL, TD[0-3], TXC, TXCREFCLK, TX_CTL }
    avtp_pps = { AVTP_PPS }
    avtp_match = { AVTP_MATCH }
    avtp_capture = { AVTP_CAPTURE }

    Notes:
      - { MDC, MDIO } groups is named "mdc" instead of "mdio"
      - Supports RGMII, but group is named "mii"


  Sergei's r8a77970 AVB proposal:

    link = { LINK }
    magic = { MAGIC }
    phy_int = { PHY_INT }
  * mdio = { MDC, MDIO }
    mii = { RD[0-3], RXC, RX_CTL, TD[0-3], TXC, TXCREFCLK, TX_CTL }
    avtp_pps = { AVTP_PPS }
    avtp_match = { AVTP_MATCH }
    avtp_capture = { AVTP_CAPTURE }

    Notes:
      * indicates difference with H3/M3/D3
      - Supports RGMII, but group is named "mii"


  Sergei's r8a77980 AVB proposal:

    link = { LINK }
    magic = { MAGIC }
    phy_int = { PHY_INT }
  * mdio = { MDC, MDIO }
  * rgmii = { RD[0-3], RXC, RX_CTL, TD[0-3], TXC, TX_CTL }
  * txcrefclk = { TXCREFCLK }
    avtp_pps = { AVTP_PPS }
    avtp_match = { AVTP_MATCH }
    avtp_capture = { AVTP_CAPTURE }

    Notes:
      * indicates difference with H3/M3/D3
      - Supports RGMII, and group is called "rgmii"
      - TXCREFCLK has its own group. Why? Similarity with GETHER on V3H?


(G)Ether:
--------

R-Mobile A1 (r8a7740) ETHER:

    rmii = { CRS_DV, MDC, MDIO, REF50CK, RXD[01], RX_ER, TXD[01], TX_EN }
    mii = { COL, CRS, MDC, MDIO, RX_CLK, RXD[0-3], RX_DV, RX_ER, TX_CLK,
            TXD[0-3], TX_EN, TX_ER }
    gmii = { COL, CRS, GTX_CLK, MDC, MDIO, REF125CK, RXD[0-7], RX_CLK,
             RX_DV, RX_ER, TX_CLK, TXD[0-7], TX_EN, TX_ER }
    int = { PHY_INT }
    link = { LINK }
    wol = { WOL }

    Notes:
      - "rmii", "mii", and "gmii" include MDC and MDIO


R-Car Gen1:

  r8a7778/r8a7779 ETHER:

    link = { LINK }
    magic = { MAGIC }
    rmii = { CRS_DV, MDC, MDIO, REF_CLK, RXD[01], RX_ER, TXD[01], TX_EN }

    Notes:
      - "rmii" includes MDC and MDIO (there's only one choice of interface)


R-Car Gen2:

  r8a7790/r8a7791/r8a7793/r8a7794 ETHER:

    link = { LINK }
    magic = { MAGIC }
    mdio = { MDC, MDIO }
    rmii = { CRS_DV, REF_CLK, RXD[01], RX_ER, TXD[01], TX_EN }


R-Car Gen3:

  Sergei's r8a77980 GETHER proposal:

    link = { LINK }
    magic = { MAGIC }
    phy_int = { PHY_INT }
    mdio = { MDC, MDIO }
    rgmii = { RD[0-3], RXC, RX_CTL, TD[0-3], TXC, TX_CTL }
    rmii = { CRS_DV, REFCLK, RXD[01], RX_ER, TXD[01], TXD_EN }
    txcrefclk = { TXCREFCLK }
    txcrefclk_mega = { TXCREFCLK_MEGA }

    Notes:
      - TXCREFCLK has its own group. I assume because one has to choose
        between TXCREFCLK and TXCREFCLK_MEGA?


Actions:
--------

  - Add missing TX_ER to "mii" group on r8a7790,
  - Rename "mdc" to "mdio" on H3/M3/D3, as the bus is called "Management
    Data Input/Output (MDIO)", add alias for backwords compatibility,
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_Data_Input/Output
  - Should we rename "mii" to "rgmii" on H3/M3/D3?
    The group does not contain all RGMII pins anyway.

Thanks for your comments!

So, do you agree having a separate SCIF_CLK function, like on all other
R-Car SoCs?
