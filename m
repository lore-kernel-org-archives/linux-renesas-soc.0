Subject: [RFC] i2c-stub: make it usable with DT when booting
Date: Tue, 16 May 2017 13:27:58 +0200
Message-Id: <20170516112758.2842-1-wsa+renesas@sang-engineering.com>
Sender: linux-renesas-soc-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-renesas-soc.vger.kernel.org>

This patch makes the stub driver parse the device tree when booting and
create a virtual bus with the desired devices attached. Here is an
example DTS snipplet making use of it. It is for simulating a more
complex camera device which has dependencies which needs to be sorted
out at boot time:

i2c@42 {
	compatible = "i2c-stub";

	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	des@4c {
		compatible = "maxim,max9268";
		reg = <0x4c>;
	};

	eeprom@57 {
		compatible = "atmel,24c02";
		reg = <0x57>;
	};
};

FIXME: can fw_* calls be used instead of of_*?

It was really useful when developing. When using fw_* calls, we probably could
make use of it with ACPI as well. Still, calling for opinions if we want this
upstream or if we want to stay module-only? Also, the binding should really
be marked as "development only". Or is it better to keep it as a separate
patch to keep the binding un-official?
