That doesn't matter much. Either way the first CPU has to provide the
master side of this device (as it needs clks for booting up) and the 2nd
gets this virtual clk device that forwards clk requests to the first
CPU.

On my machine (Udoo Neo, A9 + M4) the A9 is the primary CPU that is
started by the bootrom. If I want the M4 being the primary device I'd
need support in the bootloader to wait long enough (i.e. until the M4 is
up) before letting the A9 jump into Linux. Managable I'd say. This way
would even make sense if the M4 runs a rt critical OS that shouldn't be
forced to wait on the non-rt A9 to enable a clk.

Best regards
Uwe
