We need to think about this a bit. Is it actually the PCI host
bridge that limits the ranges here, or the bus that it is connected
to. In the latter case, the caller needs to be adapted to handle
both.

No, it won't break it, it will just fall back to swiotlb for all the
ones that are lacking the dma-ranges property. I think this is correct
behavior.

Can you elaborate? Do we have PCI host bridges that use wrongly formatted
dma-ranges properties?
