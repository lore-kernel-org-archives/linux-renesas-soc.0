Subject: [PATCH] iommu/ipmmu-vmsa: Add r8a7795 DT binding
Sender: devicetree-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-renesas-soc.vger.kernel.org>

From: Magnus Damm <damm+renesas@opensource.se>

Update the IPMMU DT binding documentation to include the r8a7795 compat
string as well as the "renesas,ipmmu-main" property that on r8a7795 will
be used to describe the topology and the relationship between the various
cache IPMMU instances and the main IPMMU.

 Required Properties:
 
-  - compatible: Must contain SoC-specific and generic entries from below.
+  - compatible: Must contain SoC-specific and generic entry below in case
+    the device is compatible with the R-Car Gen2 VMSA-compatible IPMMU.
 
     - "renesas,ipmmu-r8a73a4" for the R8A73A4 (R-Mobile APE6) IPMMU.
     - "renesas,ipmmu-r8a7790" for the R8A7790 (R-Car H2) IPMMU.
     - "renesas,ipmmu-r8a7791" for the R8A7791 (R-Car M2-W) IPMMU.
     - "renesas,ipmmu-r8a7793" for the R8A7793 (R-Car M2-N) IPMMU.

     - "renesas,ipmmu-vmsa" for generic R-Car Gen2 VMSA-compatible IPMMU.
 
   - reg: Base address and size of the IPMMU registers.
   - interrupts: Specifiers for the MMU fault interrupts. For instances that
     support secure mode two interrupts must be specified, for non-secure and

+    The first cell is a phandle to the main IPMMU and the second cell is

+    The interrupt bit number needs to match the main IPMMU IMSSTR register.

 Each bus master connected to an IPMMU must reference the IPMMU in its device
 node with the following property:
