Subject: [PATCH v2 0/3] r7s72100: dts: enable mmcif
Date: Tue, 20 Sep 2016 11:46:17 -0400

This series enables the mmc driver for the RZ/A1.
Nothing needed to be changed with the actual sh_mmcif driver.
It worked fine as-is.

As you can see, the status in the rskrza1 dst was left
as disabled because I wanted to leave that code in there
for refernce for someone later that actually has a board with
an actaul eMMC chip. I tested with an MMC Plus card.

For version 2:
* First first patch that adds the clock has already been accepted
* Add in the 3rd "card detect" interrupt that no one uses, but it
  is documented in the hardware manual so it is reflected in the
  DT.
