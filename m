No, it's a standard fixed point multiplication, where you have to compensate
for the double scaling due to the multiplication.

Perhaps the macros should be called e.g. FIXPT_MUL() and FIXPT_DIV()?

Yes, for multiplication by an integer (not a fixed point number), you can
just do the multiplication. Which also avoids having to care about rounding.
