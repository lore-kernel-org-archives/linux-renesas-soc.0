Is this supposed to have any impact on the issue on Magnus' r8a7794/alt, where
tuning failed before?

    sh_mobile_sdhi ee100000.sd: timeout waiting for hardware interrupt (CMD19)
    sh_mobile_sdhi ee100000.sd: timeout waiting for hardware interrupt (CMD19)
    sh_mobile_sdhi ee100000.sd: Tuning procedure failed
    mmc1: tuning execution failed: -110
    mmc1: error -110 whilst initialising SD card
