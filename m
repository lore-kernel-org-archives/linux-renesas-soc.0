I admit it's a bit of a hack, but it is there to get around a limitation 
of media/v4l2 framework. And the two devices are not independent, they 
are connected the same way other media entities are connected. The 
media-ctl tool will take care of propagating formats from connected 
source -> sink sub-devices, but it stops at the sub-device -> 
video_device interface. First, this propagation should happen in the 
kernel at the time a source pad format is modified, rather than by a 
user tool, because it is a media/v4l2 core requirement that source -> 
sink formats must be equal before streaming starts. Second, a source pad 
format change should also be propagated to connected video devices. 
Userland is then free to make modifications to the video_device format 
if the latter supports cropping/scaling etc., but the default should be 
to reset the format at the time the connected sub-device format has changed.
