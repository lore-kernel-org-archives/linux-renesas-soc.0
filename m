Hi Laurent,

I can definitely agree to that.

Here is my general question: Which of these 2 approaches are better?

A) In the DT, the user ask "enable Ethernet please" and magic happens in
   the pfc driver.

B) In the DT, the user looks up the correct pin/function assignments in
   the SoC Hardware Manual and manually spells out what they need.

R-Car looks more like A. I've been using a driver that looks more like B.

For most drivers (USB, MMC, SDHI, etc..,), I'm happy when 'magic happens'
and I don't really have to open a HW manual at all.
But, for something like setting up the PFC when someone gets a shiny new
board, making people actually open a HW manual seems acceptable to me.
