Subject: [PATCH/RFC 00/10] Add support for USB2.0 host/peripheral on R-Car H3

This patch set is based on the renesas-drivers.git /
renesas-drivers-2016-01-26-v4.5-rc1 tag
(commit id = 106b6565bfb6e2f35339347f3cfd0858f08bfcaa),
and the following patches:

[ renesas_usbhs driver ]
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.usb.general/135895

[ generic phy driver for R-Car H3 ]
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/2120685


This patch set contains patches that are related to generic phy driver.
As I wrote a comment in patch 8, to handle VBUS on/off for USB2.0 host
channel 0, I use a regulator driver instead of extcon/max3355 driver.
This is a reason that I marked this patch set is a RFC because I'm not
sure that this way is acceptable or not.

Also patch 6 should resolve checkpatch.pl warnings, and patch 7 should
have dmas property to use USB-DMAC.
