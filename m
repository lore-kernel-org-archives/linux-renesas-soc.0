My answer is a bit different:

With this patchset there are two variants of the SDHI driver, one that
supports SYS-DMAC via DMA Engine and one that supports on-chip bus
mastering DMA.

My understanding is that prior to this patch set the SYS-DMAC and only
variant of the SDHI driver supported fallback to PIO. And as the internal
DMAC variant uses the same core code my assumption is that it should also
have that property.  I would need to investigate things in more detail to
confirm that assumption.

In terms of supporting Gen3 with SYS-DMAC or on-chip bus mastering DMA,
I believe those cases should use compat strings and soc-match in each of
the two variants of the SDHI driver as appropriate.
