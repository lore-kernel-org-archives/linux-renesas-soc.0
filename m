I'd actually be inclined to do it *before* any other major changes, as
it would be pretty minimal given the current structure of the driver.
But then I'm free to wilfully ignore the burden of maintaining patch
stacks between both mainline and older trees ;)

Note that iommu_fwspec can be used pretty much orthogonally to any of
the core DMA ops support, so it shouldn't be as invasive as you might
think. See 84672f192671 ("iommu/mediatek: Convert M4Uv1 to
iommu_fwspec") as an example of an archdata-to-fwspec conversion of a
driver which only supports 32-bit ARM, and notably borrows its master
handling directly from the the IPMMU driver.
