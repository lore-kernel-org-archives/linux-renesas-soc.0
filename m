It's not really about "irqless", it's about being in atomic context.
irqless makes it sound like you may sleep, but the reality is sleeping
is also out (the scheduler needs IRQs to do it's job.)

So, it may be tempting to use things like msleep() in "irqless" but
that's not permissable.  So surely "atomic" would be a better name for
this?

Also, how does this get around the issue which I pointed out with (eg)
an oops occuring, which leads to a panic followed by an attempt to
reboot if the I2C bus in question is already mid-transaction?  Won't
we deadlock?
