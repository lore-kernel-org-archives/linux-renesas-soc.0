Do you have any comments about this?
(In case you lost the link to the original patch:
 https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20181113133520.20889-1-geert+renesas@glider.be/).

This is a safeguard dependency for "[PATCH v5] vfio: platform: Add
generic reset controller support"
(https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20181113131508.18246-1-geert+renesas@glider.be/).

Thanks!

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
