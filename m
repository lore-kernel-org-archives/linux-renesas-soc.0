[PATCH 10/10] iommu/ipmmu-vmsa: Hook up r8a7795 DT matching code

This series contains slightly more mature r8a7795 support for the
IPMMU driver compared to the earlier series posted as:

[PATCH/RFC 00/10] iommu/ipmmu-vmsa: Experimental r8a7795 support

The DT binding for r8a7795 has been accepted for upstream merge
and this series implements support following such format:

d4e42e7 iommu/ipmmu-vmsa: Add r8a7795 DT binding

The r8a7795 IPMMU is almost register compatible with earlier devices
like r8a7790-r8a7794, however some bitfields have been shifted
slightly. On a grander scale topology has been added and interrupts
have been reworked. So now there are several "cache" IPMMU units
without interrupt that somehow communicate with IPMMU-MM that
is the only instance that supports interrupts. The code refers to
IPMMU-MM as a "root" device and the other ones as leaf nodes.

To make this more interesting the IPMMU driver needs to be shared
between 32-bit ARM for r8a7790-r8a7794 and 64-bit ARM for r8a7795.
In practice this means that two separate implementations are needed
inside the driver to attach to the rather different architecture
specific code.

CONFIG_IOMMU_DMA=y is needed on 64-bit ARM while on 32-bit ARM
the arch specific dma-mapping code is hooked up rather directly.
During init 64-bit ARM IPMMU support is relying on IOMMU_OF_DECLARE().

The code is known to build on 32-bit and 64-bit ARM and x86_64.
Tested on 32-bit ARM and 64-bit ARM with addtional DT integration
changes.
