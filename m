There _isn't_ a framework.  What there is are a collection of Kconfig
options that multiplatform provides you that can also be selected by
any other configuration route.

(2) really doesn't apply.

The real issue is that board stuff ends up with a "depends on MULTI_xxx"
which needs to be bypassed.  That's pretty easy to do - I've done it as
a proof of concept a few years ago when this exact same thing came up
for !MMU, and since then I've been NAKing and refusing to apply patches
that try to re-use multiplat for !MMU.
