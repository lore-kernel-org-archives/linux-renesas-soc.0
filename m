Pin control on the Renesas RZ chips is performed per pin instead of per 
function (but unfortunately with the various bits of configuration split 
across a bunch of registers, otherwise we could have used pinctrl-single). 
This gives us an opportunity to move away from the sh-pfc awful (but more or 
less needed for the R-Car family) architecture and implement something much, 
much cleaner without all those obscure data tables and macros, with per-pin 
configuration. Shouldn't we rejoice and embrace that opportunity ?
