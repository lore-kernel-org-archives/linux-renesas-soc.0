I tried to track this down and my findings so far are a bit puzzling.

It seems to me that the first and only item of the "pinctrl-names" property
(a.k.a. statename) retrieved for i2c@e6508000 changes from i2c-exio0 to
i2c-exio1. Perhaps it really is overwritten for some reason. Or perhaps
there is a stale pointer.  Or perhaps I am chasing the wrong thing. But in
any case my observation is illustrated using the debug patch below.

I am testing using only the first two patches of the series applied on top
of renesas-devel-20160614-v4.7-rc3, that is the only demux devices are
i2c-exio0 and i2c-exio1.

I am using shmobile_defconfig, with CONFIG_DEBUG_PINCTRL enabled.

I am examining only i2c-8, i2c-exio0.

1. At probe time the first parent, 0:/i2c@e6500000

   i2c-demux-pinctrl i2c-8: i2c_demux_activate_master chan:0 bus_name:i2c-exio0 np->full_name/i2c@e6500000 np:ef7db76c statename:i2c-exio0
   i2c-demux-pinctrl i2c-8: i2c_demux_activate_master chan:1 bus_name:i2c-exio0 np->full_name/i2c@e6508000 np:ef7dabfc statename:i2c-exio0

2. At run time I select the second parent, 1:/i2c@e6508000.
   This works. But the statename of i2c@e6500000 is already i2c-exio1.

   i2c-demux-pinctrl i2c-8: i2c_demux_deactivate_master chan:0 bus_name:i2c-exio0 np->full_name:/i2c@e6500000 np:ef7db76c statename:i2c-exio1
   i2c-demux-pinctrl i2c-8: i2c_demux_deactivate_master chan:1 bus_name:i2c-exio0 np->full_name:/i2c@e6508000 np:ef7dabfc statename:i2c-exio0

   i2c-demux-pinctrl i2c-8: i2c_demux_activate_master chan:0 bus_name:i2c-exio0 np->full_name:/i2c@e6500000 np:ef7db76c statename:i2c-exio1
   i2c-demux-pinctrl i2c-8: i2c_demux_activate_master chan:1 bus_name:i2c-exio0 np->full_name:/i2c@e6508000 np:ef7dabfc statename:i2c-exio0

3. At run time I re-select the first parent, 0:/i2c@e6500000.
   This fails as described above. The new debug code shows.

   i2c-demux-pinctrl i2c-8: i2c_demux_deactivate_master chan:0 bus_name:i2c-exio0 np->full_name:/i2c@e6500000 np:ef7db76c statename:i2c-exio1

   [i2c_demux_deactivate_master exits before reaching debug code,
    but I have previously observed that statename is i2c-exio1
    for i2c@e6500000]

Hopefully :)

Understood. It looks like there is some more work to be done but from my
point of view fixing individual drivers is less critical than resolving
the switching issue(s) above. I think the order things are described
is probably the order in which they should be addressed.
