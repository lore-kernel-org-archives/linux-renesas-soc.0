Hi Niklas,

thanks for the submission. I was finally able to test this change.

I did regression tests on my Salvator-X trying to trigger previously
known issues. Nothing bad happened. This could be expected since START
and STOP is done in PIO mode, but one never knows :) Also did verify
that DMA is triggered for bigger transfers.

Did you have time to re-measure the threshold? Also, did you try booting
without DMA and on Gen2? We had a bit of hazzle with !DMA with the
sh_mobile-driver. Boot test and basic i2cdetect will suffice.

Patch looks good, only minor nits:

Make this one if (a || b)?

Unrelated change ;)

Thanks,
