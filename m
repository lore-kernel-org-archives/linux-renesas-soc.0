OK.

Initial setting of SW31 is ON-ON-OFF-OFF-OFF-OFF, cfr. Section 2.1.22
("SW31 (Selects GPIO/USB Connection) Specifications") of the
Salvator-XS setup manual,
which is meant to accommodate the ADV7482 on both H3 and M3-W, like
was done on Salvator-X.

OK.

OK.

OK.

While you could do this in salvator-xs.dtsi, doing so would mean users of
Salvator-X with M3-W have to change SW31 from the default configuration to
OFF-OFF-OFF-OFF-ON-ON (Note: we don't have r8a7796-salvator-xs.dts in
mainline yet).

I would keep the ADV7482 in salvator-common.dtsi using the GP6_3[01]
interrupts, like is done now.

In r8a7795-salvator-xs.dtsi, you can override the interrupts property to
GP6_{04,21}, with a comment saying:
  1. This is done to support the "usb2_ch3" pin group, and,
  2. This requires changing SW31 to OFF-OFF-ON-ON-ON-ON.

Users of Salvator-XS with M3-W don't have to change anything.

Does this sound OK?
Simon?
