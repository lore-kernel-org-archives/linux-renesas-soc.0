I tend to disagree: this is just part of the normal process of adding hardware
support incrementally.

While in this particular case hardware got (partially) enabled early due to
.dtsi sharing, the same could have happened without sharing, as DT and PFC
patches go in through different channels, and could arrive upstream in
different released versions.
