What's the final decision of this?

I saw the following revert patch in pinctrl-next but did not see a successive
patch to add output-enable back?

IMX7ULP pinctrl driver is pending on this because it needs use both
input-enable and output-enable if we want to make them generic property.

commit b4d2ea2af95cb77e2f320e24da526280d4aa2f6b

    Revert "pinctrl: generic: Add bi-directional and output-enable"

    This reverts commit 8c58f1a7a4b6d1d723bf25fef9d842d5a11200d0.

    It turns out that applying these generic properties was
    premature: the properties used in the driver using this
    are of unclear electrical nature and the subject need to
    be discussed.
