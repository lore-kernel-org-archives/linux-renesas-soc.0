Subject: [PATCH] i2c: mux: refer to i2c-mux.txt
Date: Wed,  8 Jun 2016 15:21:39 +0900
Message-Id: <1465366899-4824-1-git-send-email-horms+renesas@verge.net.au>
Sender: linux-i2c-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-renesas-soc.vger.kernel.org>

Correct references to i2c-mux.txt which was previously mux.txt.

Also correct the spelling of relevant.
