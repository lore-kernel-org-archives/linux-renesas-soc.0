The background is that this is a conversation that has been going around
for years. The basic thinking is that at this point we have documentation
that indicates that many hardware blocks on the H3 and M3-W are the same.
But we do not have insight into the internal versioning of the IP blocks
nor if they are really the same. And furthermore even if they are currently
the same we don't really know if that will continue to be the case.

Probably it is. Maybe it isn't. The response has been to take a
conservative approach to DT bindings to give us the flexibility to update
the driver implementation to reflect any differences that subsequently
surface. And by providing per-SoC bindings these driver changes can be
activated on a per-SoC basis without updating DTB files (which may be
burned into ROMs).

There is of course scope to take a different approach. But getting
consensus on this is frankly difficult. And at the very least I would
expect it to take time.

I'm sorry but I don't agree. I think that having r8a7796 support
in mainline is a higher priority than sorting this out.

I'm not opposed to that. But being consistent with my statement above
I would prefer it to be done as follow-up work.

My suspicion is that right now much of the proposed r8a7796.dtsi can be
moved into a hypothetical rcar3.dtsi. But that this is because the proposed
r8a7796.dtsi is very small. I would not expect nearly such a large
proportion of r8a7795.dtsi to be able to be moved into rcar3.dtsi because
it enables more hardware blocks and they typically have (or should have in
keeping with the prevailing policy as described above) per-SoC bindings.

I believe that there is also a another issue which is that we wish
to control enabling features on different SoCs once they are known to work.
Of course things slip through the cracks. But blindly assuming all
IP blocks enabled for one SoC work on another, even if based on the
documentation, seems to be asking for trouble to me. For one thing
it implies that the level of firmware support is the same.

As for a name, I suggest rcar-gen3.dtsi.
