Well, I agree here (please see the message regarding that I've just

Its own system-wide PM callbacks cannot be skipped, but it already
skips driver callbacks in some cases. :-)

It is unclear which issue you are talking about, but anyway, yes, they
aren't equivalent to pm_runtime_force_suspend/resume() which is quite
intentional, honestly ...

Fair enough.

Thanks a lot!
