Ah I see, I had missed that.

The patch itself should still describe the problem if it's fixing
something. The cover letter will not be available in the git-log.

Ok, so this patch supersedes "[PATCH] media: adv748x: Don't disable
CSI-2 on link_setup" ?

Ok, I found that patch and read their comments. So disabling the CSI2
might trigger a hot-plug event to the transmitter which makes them think
they have been (physically) disconnected in some way, or triggers them
to re-read the EDID which will fail. But we don't really know what the
fault is yet.

Overall this seems reasonable, only making a change to io10 when either
of the stream states are changed.

I think of "Power up" meaning at device probe time (or possibly some
runtime-pm event time). But yes, I think the distinction that it now
happens at stream_on/stream_off is important.

But the actual hardware shouldn't be updated if the stream is running
right? (I wonder if the media-controller would prevent that anyway).

Ah yes, I missed that the local variable is initialised to zero, and
this state variable is set to the result at the end of the call...

It does mean that the function ordering will be important here.

It becomes irrelevant if these conditionals move to the same point
anyway though.

I think it's only the routing choice that needs to be stored in the
state. That would minimise being stored 'globally', and the values could
be determined at the time of programming the register.
