First of all, just the clocks we know (*) are used by the R7 side *and* 
are disabled by the kernel (for a practical demo this are e.g. ~7 clocks).

(*) Yes, this is board (and R7 software) related. And yes, this might 
result in board specific r8a7795_crit_mod_clks/r8a7795_crit_core_clks[] 
tables. So yes, most probably device tree would be an option. While there is

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/clk/clk.c#n3402

unfortunately

a) its marked as "Do not use this function"

and

b) even if we would ignore (a) we couldn't figure how to use this for 
the RCar3 clocks (being no clock expert)

Best regards
