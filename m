Thanks, it would've been good to have known that ahead of time.

It's why the patch system has the KernelVersion: tag:

�6.�Kernel version.
    On a separate line, add a tag "KernelVersion: " followed by the kernel
    version that the patch was generated against. This should be formatted
    as "KernelVersion: 2.6.0-rmk1"

This is because that information is relevant for knowing where it should
be applied, and to which branch.  Having it be something else means I
have to guess, and that can result in the patch being discarded in this
manner if I don't find where it's supposed to be applied.

Yes, I know it's a pain to have to supply this information, but giving
accurate information there makes things a lot easier and quicker when
applying patches, rather than playing a game of "guess where it needs
to be applied, nope, doesn't apply there, try somewhere else."

Various people in the kernel community have different solutions to this.
For example, on netdev, it is preferred to state whether you want your
patch to be applied to "net" or "net-next" by adding that into the
"[PATCH ...]" tag in the subject line.  It's really about streamlining
the patch submission and application process.
