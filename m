It is true for all wakeup sources (e.g. Ethernet and serial).

Interrupt controllers (incl. GPIO) may, depending on SoC type:
  - be located in a controllable power area (SH/R-Mobile),
  - may run from a controllable module clock (SH/R-Mobile, R-Car Gen2/Gen3,
    RZ/A1, RZ/G1).

So there are no out-of-band IRQs in the wakeup path, unless on SoCs where
the interrupt controllers are in an always-on power area, AND run from a
fixed clock. I think only R-Car Gen1 falls in that category.
Still, R-Car Gen1 needs active_wakeup for wakeup sources.

See series "[PATCH/RFC 0/3] renesas: irqchip: Use wakeup_path i.s.o.
explicit clock handling", which includes GPIO interrupts.

So I think I do need the big hammer ;-)
