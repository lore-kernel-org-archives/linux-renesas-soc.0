That's correct.

Right, OK, this we should clarify.

Presumably the regulator driver, yes ?

Possibly to prevent a state which might be harmful until the first
consumer comes up. However this is rather theoretical.

The enable-gpios property is what turns the regulator ON/OFF , the
gpio-states is what selects the output voltage/current . Thus, I think
we should not mention "continuous operation" in the description.

Well, got any better idea ? It's not "default" either.

I suspect ignoring this property, when it's present, wouldn't be a good
idea. After all, it adds additional information about the behavior of
the system upon start up.

btw I am rewording it exactly because there was a recent breakage in the
regulator code.
