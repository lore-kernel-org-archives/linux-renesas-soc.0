Sure, people can throw anything at it ;-)

In my case, I'm wondering if the dtbo was actually invalid?
Simplification of the decompiled dtbo:

/dts-v1/;

/ {

        fragment-name {
                target-path = [2f 00];

                __overlay__ {

                        node-name {
                                compatible = "foo,bar";
                                gpios = <0xffffffff 0x0 0x0>;
                        };
                };
        };

        __fixups__ {
                bank0 = "/fragment-name/__overlay__/node-name:gpios:0";
        };
};

So it has __fixup__, but no __symbols__, which looks totally valid to me.
