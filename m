Whew, it took a long time to pound that through my thick skull :)

I think patches 1 and 3 are already in v4.5-rc1, and I applied patches 2
and 4 to my for-linus branch as below.  Please double-check and make sure
for-linus has everything you want.  I'll ask Linus to pull that before
v4.5.

commit a176cd304a8a07d6d9191126fd9bece4f67358c3

    PCI: rcar: Add gen2 device tree support for r8a7793
    
    Add "renesas,pci-r8a7793" as a compatibility string for
    "renesas,pci-rcar-gen2".
    
    This doesn't change the driver, so it does nothing by itself.  But it
    does mean that checkpatch won't complain about a future patch that adds
    "renesas,pci-r8a7793" to a DT, which helps ensure that shipped DTs use
    documented compatibility strings.
