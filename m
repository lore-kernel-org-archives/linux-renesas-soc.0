Please accept our apologies for failing to make this clearer.

I provided my soc-device-match branch (tag soc-device-match-tag1) as an
immutable base, to be included by all interested parties that need the
soc_device_match() infrastructure (Freescale/NXP, Samsung, Renesas).
Its core parts have been acked by Greg, and the fixes by Arnd and/or Greg
(the last fix only received an informal ack, that's why I hadn't added the
ack).
This branch has already been pulled by Ulf, and is present in mmc/next, as
a dependency for a Freescale/NXP driver update.

I hope my explanation helps. If anything is still unclear, please ask.
Thanks for reconsidering!

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
