I see. Yes, I was aware that the misuse of this dangling pointer is
somewhat academical. Yet, it was easy to fix and clearing this pointer
is good programming practice, I'd say. I agree that clearing the pointer
in __device_release_driver is a good option, too, if documentation about
its expected life cycle (=3D=3D get's cleared on unbind) is clear about
that. Probably that life cycle confusion led to the more complicated
code in the exynos_drm driver. I will look into all of that tomorrow.

I was wondering about that, yes.

Makes sense. Yet, as this change is gonna be small, I think it's still
nice to have.

Thanks for the input!
