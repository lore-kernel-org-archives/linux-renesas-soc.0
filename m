I had a deeper look into the issue.

What changed, is that of_dma_configure() now returns an error code,
and dma_configure() looks at it.

Actually there are two failure modes:
  1. Devices with an iommus property pointing to a disabled IOMMU node.
     These return -EPROBE_DEFER, and are now retried forever.
  2. Devices that are blacklisted in the IPMMU driver, as we don't want to
     use them with an IOMMU yet.
     These return -ENODEV, due to ipmmu_of_xlate_dma().

Thanks, this fixes the first class of failures.

The second class can be worked around using:

--- a/drivers/iommu/of_iommu.c
+++ b/drivers/iommu/of_iommu.c
@@ -196,6 +196,11 @@ static const struct iommu_ops

but obviously that's too hackish to apply...
Magnus, do you have a suggestion?

Thanks!
