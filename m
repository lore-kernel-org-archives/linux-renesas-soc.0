Subject: [PATCH v2 00/10] clk: renesas: rcar-gen2: Add new CPG/MSSR drivers

	Hi all,

Currently Renesas R-Car Gen2 SoCs use the common clk-rcar-gen2,
clk-mstp, and clk-div6 drivers, which depend on most clocks being
described in DT.  Especially the module (MSTP) clocks are cumbersome and
error prone, due to 3 arrays (clocks, clock-indices, and
clock-output-names) to be kept in sync. In addition, the clk-mstp driver
cannot be extended easily to also support module resets, which are
provided by the same hardware module.

Hence when developing support for R-Car Gen3 SoCs, another approach was
chosen, which led to the CPG/MSSR driver core, and SoC-specific
subdrivers (initially for R-Car Gen3, but later also for RZ/G1).

This series introduces new clock drivers for all supported R-Car Gen2
SoCs, using the CPG/MSSR driver core, and the support for RZ/G1.  They
provide all clocks supported by the old driver, plus a few more.
The old driver can still be used through a Kconfig option, to preserve
backward compatibility with old DTBs.

This series does not include the corresponding DTS updates.  These will
be posted as a separate series later.

Changes compared to v1:
  - Add Acked-by, Reviewed-by,
  - Add more rationale to the clock driver patch descriptions.

This series depends on "[PATCH v2] clk: renesas: Rework Kconfig and
Makefile logic", which I posted before.

For testing, this patch series, incl. all dependencies and the DTS
updates, are available in the topic/rcar2-cpg-mssr-v2 branch of my
renesas-drivers git repository at
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/geert/renesas-drivers.git.

This has been tested on r8a7790/lager, r8a7791/koelsch, r8a7792/blanche,
r8a7793/gose, and r8a7794/alt.  /sys/kernel/debug/clk/clk_summary has
been compared before and after the conversion.

I plan to queue this up in clk-renesas-for-v4.13, so the DTS updates can
be queued for v4.14 later.

Thanks!
