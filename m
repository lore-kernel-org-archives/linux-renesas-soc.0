Indeed, I think both the Exynos and Rockchip IOMMU drivers already do
cater for a device mastering though multiple discrete IOMMUs, not being
the fancy multi-port multi-context ones like yours and mine.

I guess what we could really do with is a decent abstraction of
multi-master peripherals at the device level; a "threads within the same
process" sort of granularity, as it were. I'd envisage it more along the
lines of how we handle NUMA, i.e. dma_map_page_attrs(...) becomes a
wrapper for dma_map_page_attrs_multi(..., CHANNEL_ALL), and trickier
users can call the latter with the a more specific channel(s) argument
(maybe it's a bitmask rather than an index). Meanwhile,
dev->archdata.dma_ops may point to a device-specific array of
dma_map_ops, which the DMA API backend iterates over if necessary.

Strangely, that doesn't actually sound too horrible.
