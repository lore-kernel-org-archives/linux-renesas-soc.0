Subject: [PATCH v4 00/12] ARM: dts: renesas: Update DTS for CMT DT binding rework

	Hi Simon, Magnus,

This patch series updates the CMT device nodes in the various Renesas DTS
files sh_cmt clocksource driver for the recent DT binding rework that was
merged in v4.14-rc1 and v4.15-rc1.

This series is an evolutionary improvement of Magnus Damm's series "[PATCH
v2 00/11] clocksource: sh_cmt: DT binding rework V2":

  - Patches 1-5 update the compatible values for the CMT0 and CMT1 device
    nodes on R-Mobile APE6 and R-Car Gen2,
  - Patches 6-12 remove the now obsolete "renesas,channels-mask" properties
    from the CMT device nodes on all affected SoCs.

Changes compared to v3:
  - Rebase against renesas-devel-20171127-v4.15-rc1,

Changes compared to v2:
  - Take over from Magnus,
  - Update compatible values,
  - Split in per-SoC patches,

Dependencies:
  - "[PATCH v3 0/7] clocksource: sh_cmt: Update driver for DT binding
    rework" was merged in v4.15-rc1.

This has been part of renesas-drivers for more than two months, and part
of my local development tree for more than two years.

Thanks for applying!

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
