And, ergo, multiplatform kernels and XIP_KERNEL don't go together either.
Think about it...

This is why I regard those who want multiplatform to work with options
such as XIP_KERNEL and NOMMU to be insane.

Please, can we stop trying to make multiplatform also cover the situations
where only a single class of platforms works (iow, the old way we used to
deal with platforms is the most sensible solution.)

IMHO multiplatform was done right for multiplatform but at the expense of
totally breaking stuff like XIP and noMMU.  We need to stop trying to
bend multiplatform to cover XIP and noMMU, but instead restore the old
way of handling this _along_ with multiplatform as an additional option.
