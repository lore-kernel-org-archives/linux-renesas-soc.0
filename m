Right. In the case where the external clk is populated, I imagine
there would be a DT node describing it with the clock-frequency
property if it's a fixed rate clk. If the clk is not populated on
the board, then we would have a "ground" clk node that has a
frequency of 0. This way, if we have some mux clk that is default
connected to the external clk but can switch to some internal clk
it isn't orphaned forever. This is actually a problem for orphan
clk deferral right now.

My head starts to spin when we consider something like expansion
boards that have clk pins on them though. Hopefully for things
like that, we can populate clks with DT overlays and then change
the root hierarchy of the clk tree by swapping out the "ground"
clk for some real clk on the expansion board. The usage of
strings to describe the clk tree is probably going to get us here
though. Fun!

If we can't do this DT design because of backwards compatibility
concerns, then perhaps we need to expand the core to return a
fixed rate of 0 clk whenever clk_get() is called on a provider
that's status = "disabled"? Here's an untested patch to show that
idea.
