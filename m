It seems to me that the RZ/G1C has some extra registers described for
I2C when compared with both other RZ/G1 and R-Car Gen2 SoCs.

Am I correct in assuming that operation is correct for the RZ/G1C
when using the fallback compat string for RZ/G1 and R-Car Gen2 SoCs?

And that, speculating wildly, in future it may be possible for
the driver to use these extra resgisters, f.e. by via a match on
the renesas,i2c-r8a77470 compat string?
