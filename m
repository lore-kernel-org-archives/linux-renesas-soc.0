Subject: [PATCH/RFT 0/6] i2c: recovery: fix GPIO usage for recovery
Date: Fri, 13 Jul 2018 23:09:12 +0200

I have sent the last patch of this series before, but then I realized I need to
convert all users of GPIO recovery before. I needed to make sure they all set
the SDA GPIO to output, this is what patches 3-5 are doing. Which is also good
for them because then they can send STOP at apropriate places when doing
recovery.

Then, I noticed that two drivers were not using the open drain mode for SCL
which seems like a bug to me. So, patches 1+2 address that. I'd think those two
are stable material.

Due to no hardware, I could only build test these patches. I'd be really
looking forward to comments or tests of these patches.

A branch can be found here:

Thanks,
