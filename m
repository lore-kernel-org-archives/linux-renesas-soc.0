I think moving forward we should get rid of the whole CPU/CODEC/platform
concept. This is an outdated view of how the hardware looks like. When ASoC
was initially introduce all hardware basically had a CPU side DAI, a CODEC
side DAI and a DMA. The DMA was connected to the CPU DAI and the CPU DAI was
connected to the CODEC DAI and that was it. The CPU side was also really
simple, no signal processing, no signal routing, just the raw audio data
directly transferred via DMA (or PIO sometimes) to the CPU DAI controller.
And all digital audio was assumed to be in a single digital domain running
at them same clock rate.

This no longer reflects todays typical systems. Sometimes you have more than
those three components (e.g. additional amplifier IC, BT chip ...),
sometimes you less (just a DAC or ADC directly connected to a DMA in the
SoC). You often have complex routing and processing capabilities on the host
side. Also you have often multiple digital domains with sample-rate
converters between them.

Yet still at the core ASoC keeps the CPU/CODEC/platform concept. DPCM e.g.
tries to work with these concepts by introducing frontend and backend DAIs
and use dummy components to compensate for when the software model does not
match the hardware model. This makes it code more complicated than it has to
be and less efficient than it can be.
