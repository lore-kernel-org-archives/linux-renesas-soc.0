I can assure you that it will - we constrain allocations to the
intersection of the IOMMU domain aperture (normally the IOMMU's physical
input address width) and the given device's DMA mask. If both of those
are >32 bits then >32-bit IOVAs will fall out. For the arm64/common
implementation I have prototyped a copy of the x86 optimisation which
always first tries to get 32-bit IOVAs for PCI devices, but even then it
can start returning higher addresses if the 32-bit space fills up.

As above, it impacts DMA API use for anything whose addressing
capability is narrower than the IOMMU's reported input size and whose
driver is able to blindly set a too-big DMA mask. It just happens to be
the case that the stars line up on most systems, and for 32-bit devices
who keep the default DMA mask.

I actually have a third variation of this problem involving a PCI root
complex which *could* drive full-width (40-bit) addresses, but won't,
due to the way its PCI<->AXI interface is programmed. That would require
even more complicated dma-ranges handling to describe the windows of
valid physical addresses which it *will* pass, so I'm not pressing the
issue - let's just get the basic DMA mask case fixed first.

Agreed, I'd managed to overlook that specific case, but I'd be inclined
to consider "impossible" a subset of "disallowed" still :)
