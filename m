Subject: Applied "ASoC: rsnd: remove 16ch support for now" to the asoc tree
Sender: linux-renesas-soc-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-renesas-soc.vger.kernel.org>

The patch

   ASoC: rsnd: remove 16ch support for now

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: rsnd: remove 16ch support for now

R-Car Gen3 sound device can use TDM 16ch, but its usage is very
limited. It is not yet supported.
Let's remove unexpected/unsupported channel settings for now.
This patch makes xx_ADINR register settings sanity without
runtime check.

R-Car Gen3 datasheet

40.4.7 Note on Usage of the SSIU Module
When an SSIU module is used in "TDM-16ch mode",
only the transfer with the external memory is available.
