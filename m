That's usually what I do, at least when it comes to device tree files. When 
reworking core code in a subsystem patches often have to touch multiple files, 
but that's different.

Splitting the GPIO and PFC nodes in two patches would be fine with me, but 
given that they're tightly related, I think it makes more sense to keep them 
in one patch in this particular case.

I usually try to split addition of unrelated IP cores in multiple patches. On 
the other hand, when adding multiple IP cores in one series, they often end up 
one next to the other in the source, creating conflicts if you try to backport 
selectively. I don't think that's ideal either.

In this particular case, the changes to arch/arm/boot/dts/r7s72100-genmai.dts 
are twofold :

- add a GPIO LEDs node
- configure pinctrl for the ethernet, spi and scif devices

We could split that in two patches, but I probably wouldn't split the last one 
in three patches.
