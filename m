In r-car case, I'm not sure what is the source of limitation at physical
level.

pcie-rcar driver configures ranges for PCIe inbound transactions based
on dma-ranges property in it's device tree node. In the current device
tree for this platform, that only contains one range and it is in lower
memory.

NVMe driver tries i/o to kmalloc()ed area. That returns 0x5xxxxxxxx
addresses here. As a quick experiment, I tried to add second range to
pcie-rcar's dma-ranges to cover 0x5xxxxxxxx area - but that did not make
DMA to high addresses working.

My current understanding is that host bridge hardware module can't
handle inbound transactions to PCI addresses above 4G - and this
limitations comes from host bridge itself.

I've read somewhere in the lists that pcie-rcar hardware is "32-bit" -
but I don't remember where, and don't know lowlevel details. Maybe
somebody from linux-renesas can elaborate?

I'd say - for all ones that have parents without dma-ranges property.

As of 4.10-rc2, I see only two definitions of wide parent dma-ranges
under arch/arm64/boot/dts/ - in amd/amd-seattle-soc.dtsi and
apm/apm-storm.dtsi

Are these the only arm64 platforms that can to DMA to high addresses?
I'm not arm64 expert but I'd be surprised if that's the case.

of_dma_get_range() expects <dma_addr cpu_addr size> format.

pcie-rcar.c, pci-rcar-gen2.c, pci-xgene.c and pcie-iproc.c from
drivers/pci/host/ all parse dma-ranges using of_pci_range_parser that
uses <flags pci-addr cpu-addr size> format - i.e. something different
from what of_dma_get_range() uses.
