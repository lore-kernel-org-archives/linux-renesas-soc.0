Hi Geert,
   thanks for review

You know, I've been thinking about this, bu the "pins" property
definition in pinctrl-bidings is the following one:

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt
---
- pins takes a list of pin names or IDs as a required argument. The
  specific binding for the hardware defines:
      - Whether the entries are integers or strings, and their
        meaning.
---

And all examples there assume one "pin name" or "ID" per pin.

Now, we use 2 values per each pin (the pin ID and the alternate
function number), so to me this is different from what the generic
binding describes.
Also, pinctrl-single, and pinctrl-imx which have and ABI similar to
the one this driver define, use "pinctrl-single,pins" and "fsl,pins"
respectively as property names.
So either they have to be updated yet, or we should keep using
"renesas,pins" for our own defined ABI.

Maybe Linus or other pinctrl people can give some suggestion here.

Thanks
