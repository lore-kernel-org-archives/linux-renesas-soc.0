Hi Wolfram,

Thanks for your feedback.

Good idea, will use.

I can't find any sysfs or debugfs knobs to show this information, what 
do exist is a dev_dbg in thermal_zone_set_trips() which can print 
similar information. The difference is that the trip values have not 
been clamped to the device specification in that printout since it 
happens before the call to the rcar_gen3_thermal_set_trips() call (where 
they are still clamped before anything is written to hardware):


thermal_zone_set_trips():
[    2.014173] thermal thermal_zone0: new temperature boundaries: -2147483647 < x < 120000

rcar_gen3_thermal_set_trips():
[    2.014180] rcar_gen3_thermal e6198000.thermal: TSC0: low: -40000 high: 120000

But this is for debugging so I see no issue whit dropping this debug 
printout from the driver and depend on the one from thermal core. Will 
remove this and the patch which stores tsc->dev and tsc->num form the 
next version.

That is correct, will update for next version.

All thermal zones are parsed by the thermal core by 
of_parse_thermal_zones() called from thermal_init() which is called 
using fs_initcall(thermal_init). Then the call chain

devm_thermal_zone_of_sensor_register()
    thermal_zone_of_sensor_register()
       thermal_zone_of_add_sensor()
          thermal_zone_get_zone_by_name()

Finds the zone parsed at init time, so if the zone is broken in some way 
it would not be available and devm_thermal_zone_of_sensor_register() 
would fail.

But you are correct of_thermal_get_ntrips() could return -ENODEV I will 
add check for this and error out if that is the case.
