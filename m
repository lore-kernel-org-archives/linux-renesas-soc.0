Hi,

This series adds support to control the drive strength for none GPIO
pins. All pins which can have its drive strength controlled is now supported. I
have also added the new pins to the correct groups, or added groups to mimic
other sh-pfc drivers. One notable exception is the group avb_mdc which on other
SoC are called avb_mdio, see commit 2/3 for explanation.

The series depends on the series '[PATCHv2 0/6] pinctrl: sh-pfc: Fixups
for bias handling and preparation for none GPIO pins'.

My test is a bit crude and is setting a few of the AVB pins to a higher
drive-strength value then the others and observing that the AVB fails to
work after the pfc settings are applied (NFS root failing to mount after
kernel is fetched over TFTP). I also tested setting the drive strength for
individual pins and for whole groups.

Changes since v2
- Dropped a patch to the sh-pfc driver core which is now part of the
  series this series now depends upon (this is done to simplify other
  dependencies).
- Add Reviewed-by tag

Changes since v1
- Add comment about that it's the R-Car H3SiP pin matrix which is used to
  generate a unique id number for each pin. Even if the pin matrix are
  different on other packages all the driver care about is that it's a unique
  number.
- Add FSCLKST pin after discussion with Geert
- Moved avb_mii group relative to other avb pin groups for a more logical
  order, thanks Sergei for pointing this out
- Add Acked-by and Reviewed-by tags
- Fixed spelling error
