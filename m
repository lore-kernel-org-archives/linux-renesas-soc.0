Changes since last version:

* earlier versions had one node per sensor. This version has one node for all,
  but we now have one reg entry per sensor. This makes it easier to use the
  shared resources (FUSE registers, interrupts). There is no driver support
  for shared resources yet, but it will be added incrementally.

* interrupt property specified. We make clear now that all interrupts routed
  must be specified in the binding. It is up to the driver if and how it makes
  use of them. Currently, there is no interrupt support, but it will be added
  later.

* due to the well-specified reg entries, no need anymore for aliases.

* fixed register range for TSC1.

* reformatted paragraphs and fixed some typos.

+* DT bindings for Renesas R-Car Gen3 Thermal Sensor driver
+
+On R-Car Gen3 SoCs, the thermal sensor controllers (TSC) control the thermal
+sensors (THS) which are the analog circuits for measuring temperature (Tj)
+inside the LSI.
+
+Required properties:
+- compatible		: "renesas,<soctype>-thermal",
+			  Examples with soctypes are:
+			    - "renesas,r8a7795-thermal" (R-Car H3)
+			    - "renesas,r8a7796-thermal" (R-Car M3-W)
+- reg			: Address ranges of the thermal registers. Each sensor
+			  needs one address range. Sorting must be done in
+			  increasing order according to datasheet, i.e.
+			  TSC1, TSC2, ...
+- clocks		: Must contain a reference to the functional clock.
+- #thermal-sensor-cells : must be <1>.
+
+Optional properties:
+
+- interrupts           : interrupts routed to the TSC (3 for H3 and M3-W)
+- power-domain		: Must contain a reference to the power domain. This
+			  property is mandatory if the thermal sensor instance
+			  is part of a controllable power domain.
+
+Example:
+
+	tsc: thermal@e6198000 {
+		compatible = "renesas,r8a7795-thermal";
+		reg = <0 0xe6198000 0 0x68>,
+		      <0 0xe61a0000 0 0x5c>,
+		      <0 0xe61a8000 0 0x5c>;
+		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 67 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
+			     <GIC_SPI 68 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
+			     <GIC_SPI 69 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
+		clocks = <&cpg CPG_MOD 522>;
+		power-domains = <&sysc R8A7795_PD_ALWAYS_ON>;
+		#thermal-sensor-cells = <1>;
+		status = "okay";
+	};
+
+	thermal-zones {
+		sensor_thermal1: sensor-thermal1 {
+			polling-delay-passive = <250>;
+			polling-delay = <1000>;
+			thermal-sensors = <&tsc 0>;
+
+			trips {
+				sensor1_crit: sensor1-crit {
+					temperature = <90000>;
+					hysteresis = <2000>;
+					type = "critical";
+				};
+			};
+		};
+	};
