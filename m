Oh, this seems to differ for different revisions of the schematics.
R5.1 has the ISSI part, R3.4 has the SST part.

Due to "jedec,spi-nor", it will auto-detect, but IIRC, the driver will warn
if the compatible doesn't match the detected part, which thus may happen
for some boards.

OK.

So some boards have a dual-capable part, others don't.

I'm not 100% sure, but I think writing <2> will still work, as the driver
won't use dual mode on the SST25VF016B part, due to lack of
SPI_NOR_DUAL_READ in the entry in the spi-nor driver.
