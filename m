Yes, that's better and is getting common on newer platforms. They have
separate M-class(or even low A-class e.g. A5/A7) processors to handle
all the system management.

The new ARM SCMI specification[0][1] is designed to standardize the
interface. It covers the clocks in clock protocol.

I think that is platform specific. On few platforms I have seen
recently, it's M4 or whatever core that handles system power management
boots first and is responsible to even boot secondaries.

Exactly.
