Subject: [RFC PATCH] mmc: sunxi: drop superfluous error message
Date: Sun,  8 Oct 2017 16:50:08 +0200
Message-Id: <20171008145009.17550-1-wsa+renesas@sang-engineering.com>
Sender: linux-renesas-soc-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-renesas-soc.vger.kernel.org>

This error message can go because a) currently nothing else than
EPROBE_DEFER is returned and b) if this is going to change a much more
detailed error message should come from mmc_regulator_get_supply()
anyhow.

While I think this patch is correct as is (because of this discussion [1]), I
still wonder about the intention of the now removed message. Because a not
supplied vmmc is not determined by the return value of *_get_supply(), but by a
check if mmc->supply.vmmc is populated afterwards. So, if this was the original
intention such a check would need to be implemented on top of this patch.
