	Hi Simon, Magnus,

This patch series adds support for the external crystal feeding SCIF_CLK
to (H)SCIF on the various Renesas R-Car Gen1, Gen2, and Gen3 development
boards.  This increases the range and accuracy of supported baud rates.
Support for this has been accepted in the driver in v4.5-rc1.

Changes compared to v3:
  - Change one-line summary prefix to match current arm-soc practices,
  - Tested on r8a7794/alt,
  - Rebased,

Changes compared to v2:
  - Add support for r8a7778/bockw, r8a7779/marzen, r8a7790/lager,
    r8a7791/porter, r8a7793/gose, r8a7794/alt, and r8a7794/silk,
  - Add Reviewed-by.

Testing:
  - This was tested locally on r8a7791/koelsch and r8a7795/salvator-x,
  - This was tested remotely on r8a7778/bockw, r8a7779/marzen, and
    r8a7794/alt,
  - This has been in renesas-drivers for a while, so I assume it has
    received basic testing on other boards,
  - Hints for various levels of testing:
      - Change the "dev_dbg" after "done:" in
	drivers/tty/serial/sh-sci.c to "dev_info" to print clock and bit
	rate,
      - "yes U | tr -d '\n' > /dev/ttySCx" outputs a square wave with a
        frequency of half the bit rate on TXD,
      - Modifying the frequency of SCIF_CLK causes garbage on the serial
        console, unless you compensate by changing the bit rate in
        /chosen/stdout-path,
      - If you disable the SCIF_CLK, the brg_int clock will be used. If
        you change that clock, you'll get garbage again.

Dependencies:
  - renesas-devel-20160129-v4.5-rc1,
  - series "[PATCH v4 0/7] ARM: dts: R-Car: Add SCIF fallback
    compatibility strings",
  - series "[PATCH v4 00/11] ARM: dts: shmobile: Rename the serial port
    clock to fck",
  - series "[PATCH v4 0/7] ARM: dts: r-car: Add BRG support for
    (H)SCIF".

Thanks for applying!
