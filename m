That could be doable, as when we're collecting generic pin
configuration to apply to the pin I can simply check if both of them
are enabled.

That would feel un-natural in dts anyway, for someone that is not that
into the pin controller sub system details.
If I would have to do something like  this, not knowing all the
reasonable pre-conditions we've been discussing about

pins {
    pinmux = < .. >;
    input-enable;
    output-high; /* or output-low, we can ignore the argument here */
}

In place of

pins {
   pinmux = < .. >;
   renesas,bi-directional;
}

And the hardware manual speaks of "bi-directional" everywhere, I would
be wondering what those guys implementing this were thinking :)

Chris already gave some valid reasons why it would be hard to do this
considering the different part numbers this driver may handle, but I
would also like to add that I have counted > 100 cases where
bi-directional flag has to be applied just in the first 5 IO ports (on a
total of 13).

As there are RZ systems out there running with just < 9MB of SRAM,
adding a static table (or several, considering the different part numbers)
with at least 300 entries, is a considerable waste :(

For SWIO it would be easier, there are just 16 cases, all of them
listed in the hardware reference manual as Chris said.

Thanks
