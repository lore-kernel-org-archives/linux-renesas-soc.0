    It should be, yes -- but 7740 has completely different Ether core than the 
RZ/G family. I can fix this if you want...

    Well, I think for 779x it does, provided that the Ether core exists at all.
For 777x it doesn't support the SH flavour of 7778 indeed but it's not 
supported by the kernel at all...

   Thank you. :-)
