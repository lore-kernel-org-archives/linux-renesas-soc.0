Subject: [PATCH/RFC v3 0/6] mmc: renesas_sdhi: add R-Car Gen-3 DMA support

Hi,

this short series adds support for R-Car Gen-3 Internal DMAC to the SDHI
driver.

The approach taken is as follows:

1. Refactor the TMIO DMA code so that it is provided by a set of callbacks
   rather than compiled-in function calls; Refactor the DMA SDHI to use
   this.
2. Rename tmio_mmc_dma.c as renesas_sdhi_sysc_dmac.c which better reflects
   what it is is, particularly after step 2.
3. Add max_segs restriction
4. Add Gen3 DMA code as a separate set of callbacks

Changes since v2:
* Correct discrepancies with BSP v3.2.2 in intermal DMAC implementation.
* Correctly set mmc->max_blk_count in accordance with max_segs.
  This appears to boost performance from ~4.7Mb/s to ~11Mb/s.
* Allow fallback to PIO
* Correct name of SYS DMAC

Changes since v1:
* Cleanup and more renaming as suggested by Wolfram Sang
* max_segs restriction

Testing:

As described on http://elinux.org/Tests:r-car-gen3-sdhi-dma

Previously performance of 4.7Mb/s was reported.
With this series performance of 11Mb/s has been achieved.
However, this is still lower than the 20Mb/s I originally expected.
