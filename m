Don't rely on locking in the core for register locking within a
device. That makes a dependency headache if we want to rework the
locking scheme in the core, which we want to do eventually.

Also, please don't cause side effects during recalc_rate(). The
callback is meant to calculate the rate of the clock, not adjust
hardware based on what arguments are passed to it.
