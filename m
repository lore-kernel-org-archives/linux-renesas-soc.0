Except for one thing which may or may not be a concern here.

Suspend to idle should only go into states in which all of the available wakeup
devices work.  If there are devices that cannot wake you up from a given state,
this isn't "idle" any more, is it?

As for the device wakeup disable/enable interface, it is for controlling
whether or not a given device should be allowed to generate wakeup signals at
all.

The information on what states a given device can wake up the system from is
platform-specific and generally would need to be taken into consideration at
the platform level.
