Oh! That's weird I don't have that statement in my manual (public 
version R01UH0403EJ0060 Rev.0.60)

The only description for PMSR I have is:

"This register provides an alternative method for writing data to the 
PMn register.
The higher 16 bits of the PMSRn register specify whether data can be 
written to the PMn.PMnm bit specified by the
lower 16 bits of the PMSRn register."

So I assumed it was one direction only
