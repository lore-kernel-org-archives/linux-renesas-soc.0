I wasn't thinking quite that far, though that is also a theoretical
problem. However, the simple solution would be to have a bit in the DMA
specifier let the driver know whether translation is needed or not.

The simpler case I was thinking of is where the entire DMA engine
either goes through an IOMMU or doesn't (depending on the integration
into the SoC), so we'd have to find out through some DT property
or compatible string in the DMA enginen driver.

Do you mean a theoretical problem, or a chip that you already know exists?

Agreed, that can become interesting.
