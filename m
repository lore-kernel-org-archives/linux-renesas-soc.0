Feels correct not to reset this, the iommu drivers in question, seems to
creating mapping/attaching in add_device path (which gets called before the
clients gets probed) and when the iommu client gets deferred/reprobed that
does not happen again even after the first round.

Thanks for the above, i had the same thing to be posted, was just testing it once.
There are three patches [1][2], already posted and third one for the issue that Geert
pointed i did below (Geert had a patch little differently to ignore -ENODEV).
I had this question previously for not propagating errors apart from EPROBE_DEFER,
did not have an issue reported at that time. Anyways if the below is ok, i will
just send the 3 patches in one set for easy picking up ?

[1] https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/5/16/25  
[2] The above one that you have. 
[3] The below one, if its fine ?

Subject: [PATCH] of: iommu: Ignore all errors except EPROBE_DEFER

While deferring the probe of iommu masters,
xlate and add_device callback can passback error values
like -ENODEV, which means iommu cannot be connected
with that master for real reasons. So rather than
killing the master's probe for such errors, just
ignore the errors and let the master work without
an iommu.
