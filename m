Okay!

Can you perhaps clarify which 6 devices/drivers that are involved, and
perhaps also point out if their child devices?

Okay, so the problem remains no matter which solution for wakeup you
pick in genpd.

Then this seems to point to that the driver may be misbehaving in some
way. I can help to check what is going on.
