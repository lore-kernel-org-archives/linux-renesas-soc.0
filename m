The above notwithstanding I have applied this patch for v4.14.

This is under the assumption that:
a) the relevant (pfc) driver changes will appear in v4.14 and;
b) there is no regression introduced in having this change present
   without the driver changes

An implication of the above is that the new feature will not work
until both the driver and DTS changes are in the same tree. But that the
trees with each of those changes continue to work at least as well as they
did before.

Please test the devel branch that I push later today to make sure there
are no regressions.
