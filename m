This is just a convenience dating way back before device tree.  The one
thing it is still useful for is identifying when a part is different from
what the devicetree suggests - particularly when fairly generic compatibles
are in use but the device has an ID register.  In a lot of consumer
boards these chips get changed to 'newer' (i.e. cheaper) versions that
are more or less compatible without any devicetree changes (or
longer ago without it being reflected in difference in the board file).

If you want to know the device tree node it is easily available via
/sys/bus/iio/device/iio:deviceX/uevent for example.
Having just fired up a beaglebone blue I have:

root@beaglebone:/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0# cat uevent 
MAJOR=243
MINOR=0
DEVNAME=iio:device0
DEVTYPE=iio_device
OF_NAME=mpu9150
OF_FULLNAME=/ocp/i2c@4819c000/mpu9150@68
OF_COMPATIBLE_0=invensense,mpu9150
OF_COMPATIBLE_N=1
root@beaglebone:/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0# cat name
mpu9150

Which is actually lying as it's a 9250 - my fault in this case as I
wrote the relevant bit of the device tree and it's not mainlined yet.

root@beaglebone:/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device1# cat uevent 
MAJOR=243
MINOR=1
DEVNAME=iio:device1
DEVTYPE=iio_device
OF_NAME=bmp280
OF_FULLNAME=/ocp/i2c@4819c000/bmp280@76
OF_COMPATIBLE_0=bosch,bmp280
OF_COMPATIBLE_N=1
root@beaglebone:/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device1# cat name
bmp280

root@beaglebone:/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device2# cat uevent 
MAJOR=243
MINOR=2
DEVNAME=iio:device2
DEVTYPE=iio_device
OF_NAME=adc
OF_FULLNAME=/ocp/tscadc@44e0d000/adc
OF_COMPATIBLE_0=ti,am3359-adc
OF_COMPATIBLE_N=1
root@beaglebone:/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device2# cat name
TI-am335x-adc

root@beaglebone:/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device3# cat uevent 
MAJOR=243
MINOR=3
DEVNAME=iio:device3
DEVTYPE=iio_device
OF_NAME=ax8975
OF_FULLNAME=/ocp/i2c@4819c000/mpu9150@68/i2c-gate/ax8975@c
OF_COMPATIBLE_0=ak,ak8975
OF_COMPATIBLE_N=1
root@beaglebone:/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device3# cat name
ak8975

So all the info you could possibly want in in userspace is
available without using the name attribute - even down to
the complex nature of the path to that ak8975.

At various points in the past submitters have put drivers
in with the devicetree node or other bus related naming
and we haven't always picked up on it in review.
As we can't break userspace ABI not much we can do about it
now unfortunately. 

Mind you, this has reminded me that I need to fix that mpu9150
case above before anyone mainlines the devicetree for the blue.

That's ideal. It should be as specific as we can make it.
