Ah, right, I did indeed misunderstand. The IOMMU code is happy with the
DMA masks changing, since it always checks the appropriate one at the
point of IOVA allocation. The initial size given to
__iommu_setup_dma_ops() really just sets up a caching threshold in the
IOVA domain - if there is an explicitly-configured mask, then it's
generally good to set the limit based on that, but otherwise the default
32-bit limit is fine even if the driver subsequently alters the device's
mask(s) before making DMA API calls. Your patch won't actually change
any behaviour in this regard, as long as it still passes a 4GB size by
default.

Robin.
