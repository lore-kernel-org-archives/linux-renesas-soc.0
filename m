The irq_desc is per pin, while suspend is called per platform device, which
contains one or more irq_chips, each serving one or more pins.
So checking for IRQD_WAKEUP_STATE means looping over all irq_descs
associated to the platform device.

Which made me realize {gpio_rcar,irqc,intc_irqpin}_priv.wakeup_path should
not be a flag, but a counter. Currently it works by luck, as we never have
two independent wake-up sources being routed through the same irqchip.
