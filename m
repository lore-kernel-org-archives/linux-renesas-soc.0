Subject: [PATCH renesas/devel 00/13] ARM, arm64: dts: Use R-Car fallback bindings for i2c/iic nodes

Hi,

this short series makes use of newly added R-Car fallback bindings in
i2c and iic nodes of the DTs for SoCs where the drivers in question are
already used.

This should have no run-time effect at this time as the current
driver implementations use the same initialisation squeuences for
SoC-specific and R-Car fallback bindings for all the cases covered by
this patch-set.

Based on renesas-devel-20161212-v4.9
