Yes, that's something that has been confusing me. Why does there need to 
be a distinction between a media control mode non-mc mode in the 
rcar-vin driver? I understand the "digital"/"parallel" mode is to handle 
sensors with a parallel interface (as opposed to MIPI CSI-2), but why 
not make the parallel sensors also require media-control 
(enabling/disable media links, etc.)?

Ok. What I did for imx-media driver is to export a function from the 
video capture interface that allows the source sub-device connected to 
the capture interface to call it when the source pad format changes, 
which gives the capture interface the chance to adjust compose window 
(unlike rcar-vin, imx capture interface doesn't crop or scale, the 
connected source subdev does that, but it does pad the compose window so 
it needs to know the original compose window, sorry hope I haven't lost 
you). Anyway I think catching the V4L2_EVENT_SOURCE_CHANGE event is 
maybe a cleaner way to update the crop bounds in rcar-vin than using an 
exported function.

How about embedding the 'struct v4l2_device' into 'struct rvin_group' 
instead of 'struct rvin_dev'? That probably makes more sense, the 
v4l2_dev keeps track of media-device-wide info such as the list of 
sub-devices in the graph, so it seems more appropriate to create only 
one instance of v4l2_dev. That will force rcar-vin to lookup the correct 
VINs to forward the event to, since v4l2_dev is no longer attached to 
the VINs.

But moving events from v4l2 to media (e.g. media entities send events to 
the mdev, rather than v4l2 sub-devices sending events to the v4l2_dev) 
is also an interesting idea.

I haven't been tuned into that topic, but yes I agree that events need a 
better framework.

Well, from 6c51f646f6 ("media: rcar-vin: fix handling of single field 
frames (top, bottom and alternate fields)"),

"There was never proper support in the VIN driver to deliver ALTERNATING 
field format to user-space, remove this field option. The problem is 
that ALTERNATING field order requires the sequence numbers of buffers 
returned to userspace to reflect if fields were dropped or not, 
something which is not possible with the VIN drivers capture logic."

Is that still a concern, or can alternate mode be brought back but with 
possibly the above limitation?

Also, there is this paragraph in [1] regarding V4L2_FIELD_NONE, so it 
sounds like using this field type in this way may not be too much abuse :)

"Images are in progressive format, not interlaced. The driver may also 
indicate this order when it cannot distinguish 
between|V4L2_FIELD_TOP|and|V4L2_FIELD_BOTTOM|."
