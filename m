DT allows specifying multiple compatible strings in decreasing order of 
genericity to make generic OS implementations possible while retaining the 
ability to later introduce device-specific code if/when the need arises 
(mostly because of information that were overlooked, misunderstood or just not 
available at implementation time - we unfortunately can't produce 100% perfect 
solutions all the time, I very much regret that). This is exactly what the 
LVDS panel bindings mandate.
