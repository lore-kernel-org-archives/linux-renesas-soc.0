The run-time effect is that a few cycles are saved because CBSY signals
ready a bit earlier than SCLKDIVEN. Though, the more important aspect is
that docs explicitly say to wait for CBSY. That's why this change was
requested although I don't think it will matter much in practice.

I don't have docs for R-Car Gen1 SDHI. But given that even Gen2 has one
SDHI instance without CBSY and Gen1 is older, my educated guess is that
it does not have CBSY.
