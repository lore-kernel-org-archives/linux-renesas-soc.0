I do think they have a useful purpose in representing the edges of chips
in a convenient bundle and inject configuration.  I too would like to
see them less prominent in the code internals but they are useful as an
interface.

I actually keep thinking that it might be easier to refactor the simple
CPU plus platform SoCs into components than anything else - there's
going to be gotchas in there but it seems like a useful string to pull
at.  Though realistically if we're going to get companies working on
this it's probably easier to get DPCM people started off.
