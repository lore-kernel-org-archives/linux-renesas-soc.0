So you not only dropped the (controversial) timing related properties, but
in addition:

+               cache-unified;
+               cache-level = <2>;

At least the "cache-level" property is marked as required in ePAPR.
For "cache-unified", the wording is not that strict in ePAPR, but that property
depends on being a unified cache in the first place.

So I think these two properties should be re-added.

Sorry for not noticing before.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
