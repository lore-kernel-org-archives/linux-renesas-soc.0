It seems that these patches are targeted at the renesas tree.
The best practice in that case is to base patches on the latest
devel branch. Please consider doing so in future.

The patches themselves seem good to me, however, I would like to enquire
about testing. In particular, have you tested CPU hotplug and suspend to
RAM with these patches (and without in the case of the latter)?

I am cautious about any regressions that may creep in
when going from UP to SMP.
