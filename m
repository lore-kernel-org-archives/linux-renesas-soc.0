Just to show why I think this helps, here's my testing.


I first discovered this with the RSPI driver where it would stop working. T=
he reason is that after the clock is turned back on, it would do a read/mod=
ify/write on a register. But, sometimes the register value would come back =
as 0x00...to it would go from Master mode to Slave mode.

So to demonstration this, I ran the following code below on boot up.
WITHOUT this patch I'm proposing, you will get the following message printe=
d out many times (every time SPCR is read as 0x00 instead of its correct va=
lue of 0x40)

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3DSPCR=3D00 SPSR=3D60 SPCMD=3D078B
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3DSPCR=3D00 SPSR=3D60 SPCMD=3D078B
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3DSPCR=3D00 SPSR=3D60 SPCMD=3D078B
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3DSPCR=3D00 SPSR=3D60 SPCMD=3D078B
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3DSPCR=3D00 SPSR=3D60 SPCMD=3D078B
etc...


However, WITH this patch applied, you will never get this message (meaning =
this patch fixes this issue).


Unfortunately, I think some peripherals like RIIC (I2C) still need more tim=
e to become fully working...but that's a different topic.


For reference, here was the test code I was running to show this effect.

	/* MSTP testing */
	{
		struct clk *rspi4_clk;
		void *rspi4_base =3D ioremap_nocache(0xE800E800, 0x30);
		u8 spcr =3D 0xFF;
		u8 spsr =3D 0xFF;
		u16 spcmd =3D 0xFFFF;
		int i;

		/* set SPCR to 0x40 (reset: SPCR =3D 0x00) */
		rspi4_clk =3D clk_get_sys(NULL,"spi4");
		clk_prepare_enable(rspi4_clk);
		udelay(1000);
		*(u8 *)rspi4_base =3D 0x40;
		udelay(1000);
		clk_disable_unprepare(rspi4_clk);
		msleep(100);

		for (i=3D0;i<1000;i++)
		{
			/* Enable Clock */
			clk_prepare_enable(rspi4_clk);

			/* read registers */
			spcr =3D *(u8 *)(rspi4_base);	/* 0x40 =3D OK */
			spsr =3D *(u8 *)(rspi4_base + 3); /* 0x60 =3D OK */
			spcmd =3D *(u16 *)(rspi4_base + 0x10);/* 0x070D =3D OK */

			/* value=3D0 is BAD data */
			if (!spcr || !spsr || !spcmd)
				printk("=3D=3D=3D=3D=3DSPCR=3D%02X SPSR=3D%02X SPCMD=3D%04X\n", spcr,sp=
sr,spcmd);

			/* Disable Clock */
			clk_disable_unprepare(rspi4_clk);
		}
	}
