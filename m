Subject: [PATCH 13/26] ARM: dts: wheat: initial device tree
Date: Wed,  7 Sep 2016 09:50:00 +0200
Message-Id: <5f45cec40402188a269dd56e9a1a569cc4849014.1473234371.git.horms+renesas@verge.net.au>

From: Sergei Shtylyov <sergei.shtylyov@cogentembedded.com>

Add the initial device tree for the R8A7792  SoC based Wheat board.
The Wheat board itself has  no serial ports  wired up, the USB serial chips
are situated on a separate  debug board and  one of them is connected to
SCFI0  -- include unconditional support for  it, so that the serial console
can work.

Based  on the original (and large) patch by Vladimir Barinov
<vladimir.barinov@cogentembedded.com>.
