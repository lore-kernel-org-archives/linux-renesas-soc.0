Please CC me if you want me to merge your code, I monitor linux-pci
but that would help me, thanks.

You did not add the review tags you received to the new series (also a
cover letter - however minimal - and a version number would help),
please add them and post a v2 so that I can merge them, I can do that
for you but it is good practice for the future.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
