A lot of CODECs can to varying degrees tolerate this but it will tend to
show up in performance numbers, it's often not immediately obvious just
=66rom a listening test.  Usually those that don't mind have a FLL or PLL
they're using to generate the actual audio master clock at a useful rate
for dividing down, or sometimes fancy digital logic to match things
up.

It's not a problem to have this configurable, I'm just thinking it might
be better to have the default be the other way around so that we default
to synchronous but can turn that off if it's required.
