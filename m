Urgh, I really should have spotted the significance of "NVMe", but 
somehow it failed to click :(

Of course the existing code works fine for everything *except* PCI 
devices on DT-based systems... That's because of_dma_get_range() has 
never been made to work correctly with the trick we play of passing the 
host bridge of_node through of_dma_configure(). I've got at least 2 or 3 
half-finished attempts at improving that, but they keep getting 
sidetracked into trying to clean up the various new of_dma_configure() 
hacks I find in drivers and/or falling down the rabbit-hole of starting 
to redesign the whole dma_pfn_offset machinery entirely. Let me dig one 
up and try to constrain it to solve just this most common "one single 
limited range" condition for the sake of making actual progress...
