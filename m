A few years ago, I got bashed by Linus for rebasing the m68k "for-linus"
branch on every -rc.

100% immutable is not needed.

Hmm, that would be more work on your side. Plus communication overhead.

OK.

I think you're about the only one who does that ;-)

OK.

The purpose is to make it easier for the upstream Renesas kernel team and
associated testers to consume our work-in-progress.

Hence I merge the for-next branches of selected subsystems, followed by
topic branches with work-in-progress driver code.

E.g. Simon had asked me to include
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/horms/renesas.git
topic/sdhi-gen3-dma-2017
That branch was based on your mmc/next.

But by the time I created the renesas-drivers release, mmc/next had been
rebased.  Hence after merging the new mmc/next, I had to rebase his work:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/geert/renesas-drivers.git/log/?h=topic/sdhi-gen3-dma-2017-rebased1

I hope this explains our problem.

Thanks!
