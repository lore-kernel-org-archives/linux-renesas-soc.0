Hello.

   Here's the set of 11 patches against Simon Horman's 'renesas.git' repo's
'renesas-devel-20161027-v4.9-rc2' tag plus the R8A7743/SK-RZG1M patch series.
I'm adding the device tree support for the R8A7745-based SK-RZG1E board.
The SoC is close to R8A7794 and the board seems identical to the R8A7794/SILK
board. The device tree patches depend on the R8A7745 CPG/MSSR driver series
just posted in order to compile and work.
