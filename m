Thanks, I was wondering what the best way to handle this is.

I tried your suggestion above but it seems that host->mmc->can_retune is
zero when ->runtime_resume() is called because of the following call paths:

a) _mmc_sd_suspend()
     -> mmc_power_off()
        -> mmc_set_initial_state()
	   -> mmc_retune_disable
   and
b) mmc_sd_runtime_resume()
     -> mmc_power_up
        -> mmc_set_initial_state()
	   -> mmc_retune_disable

I plan to repost this patchset without the tap restoration code.
This is because I have a number of changes locally, in particular
to address other parts of your review, and I would like
them to see the light of day.

I will mark the tap restoration as a TODO item which we can address
before merging the code in question.
