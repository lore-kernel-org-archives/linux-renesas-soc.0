I did miss a small difference in topology: in pm/linux-next, H3 has DMA
enabled for SCIF2, while M3 hasn't (yet).
With DMA enabled on M3, it fails in the same way.

As genpd_resume_noirq() no longer calls pm_runtime_force_resume(),
rcar_dmac_runtime_resume() is no longer called, and the DMAC's registers
are no longer reinitialized after system resume, breaking the serial port.
