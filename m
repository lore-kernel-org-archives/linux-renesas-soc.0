OK.

I do not mean that -EINVAL is correct. Obviously it isn't. But blindly
replacing -EINVAL by zero may not be the right solution neither.

If recalc_rate cannot return an error value, perhaps there is a good reason
for that?

I see there's a similar check in cpg_sd_clock_enable(), so the clock also
cannot be enabled if this condition is met?

When does this happen? If the firmware leaves a invalid/unsupported setting
in the register? If we can't recover from that, perhaps the clock's probe
should just fail instead?

It looks like the only writer of that field is cpg_sd_clock_set_rate(),
which always writes a valid/supported value. Is it guaranteed that this
function is always called first?
If yes, the checks can just be removed instead?

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

                        Geert
