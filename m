Does that include power areas?

I can find CPU_ON and CPU_OFF in the PSCI specification, but not
CPU_RET?

How is the cluster ON/OFF/RET called exactly? I can't find any CLUSTER_*
calls in the PSCI specification.

Or prevent the system from doing that...

On these SoCs, the individual CPU cores and the SCU/L2 are in separate
(nested) power areas.  Perhaps these power areas are turned off when
disabling the CPU cores, but not when suspending them.

Sure. But not automatic, as it needs fiddling with mem_sleep.

After patch 4, if needed (DT property + extra wake-up sources configured),
psci_system_suspend_enter() will call cpu_do_idle() instead of
psci_system_suspend(). No need to fiddle with mem_sleep manually.

I think that task isn't complete yet.
