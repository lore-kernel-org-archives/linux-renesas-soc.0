Where is this explicitly states for the first partition?

Better, it also depends on the documented behavior:

Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt refers to
drivers/mtd/cmdlinepart.c, which states:

 * <offset>  := standard linux memsize
 *              if omitted the part will immediately follow the previous part
 *              or 0 if the first part

None of the examples listed there or under the MTD_CMDLINE_PARTS Kconfig
help text, or in a defconfig bundled with the kernel, use @0 for the first
partition.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
