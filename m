Subject: [PATCH 2/2] ARM: dts: r8a7792: remove ADSP clock
Date: Mon, 18 Jul 2016 11:39:43 +0900
Message-Id: <e0c3f92a08f3e0a95024d0d032564fdc1ee96f54.1468808109.git.horms+renesas@verge.net.au>

From: Sergei Shtylyov <sergei.shtylyov@cogentembedded.com>

Simon Horman told me that R8A7792 has ADSP clock based on an incorrect
table in the most recent R-Car gen2 manual. But when I received that manual
I discovered that this is false: R8A7792 is the only Gen 2 SoC that doesn't
have ADSP at all.  Accordingly remove the ADSP clock from DT for the
r8a7792.
