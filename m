Off topic is good ;-)

Yes I'm driving the upstreaming of most of those out of tree patches.  
Currently a lot of them are blocked on the organic growth of the 
addition of Gen3 and my lack of understanding of v4l2 at the time. Now I 
know better and I'm in the process of cleaning up the driver to prepare 
upstreaming most of them. I will send out the first cleanup patch later 
today.

I have in the past tried to upstream all patches and then cleanup the 
feature complete driver but it's gotten to a point where that is more 
painful then doing the right thing (tm).

If there is any particular patch that would be helpful for you to have 
upstream earlier then others let me know and I can try to put it first 
in the queue.

The vin-tests at ragnatech.se is the parent one. It's not as nice as the 
vsp-tests and I would like to add more tests and rewrite it in python3.  
If you have additional tests pleas send me patches and I will be happy 
to include them.

One idea I would really like to do is a HDMI loopback test. Connecting 
the DU and VIN and running tests on that to allow automatic testing of 
multiple resolutions and in the future scaling. As it is now all 
vin-tests depends on external video sources. An alternate idea to this 
is to create a remote "video server" on a RPi as it can deliver both 
HDMI and CVBS video...

I see no issue with using a kernel test framework but I have little 
experience in that area and it's not something I'm planing on worknig on 
at the moment.
