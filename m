Subject: [PATCH/RFC] ARM: dts: armadillo800eva: Split LCD mux and gpio
Date: Wed, 24 May 2017 13:43:34 +0200
Message-Id: <1495626214-15502-1-git-send-email-geert+renesas@glider.be>
Sender: linux-renesas-soc-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-renesas-soc.vger.kernel.org>

Configuration of the lcd0 pinmux group and GPIO hog for the external
GPIO mux are done using a single device node, causing the "output-high"
property to be applied to both.  This will fail for the pinmux group,
but doesn't cause any harm, as the failure is ignored silently.

However, after "pinctrl: sh-pfc: propagate errors on group config", the
failure will become fatal, leading to a broken display:

    sh-pfc e6050000.pin-controller: pin_config_group_set op failed for group 102
    sh-pfc e6050000.pin-controller: Error applying setting, reverse things back
    sh-pfc e6050000.pin-controller: failed to select default state

Split the configuration in two subnodes, and replace the GPIO hog by a
pull-up pin bias to fix this.

This is a hard dependency for "pinctrl: sh-pfc: propagate errors on
group config" (https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9186713/).

Notes:
  1. Just keeping the GPIO hog doesn't work, as the sh-pfc driver
     requires each pinctrl (sub)node to have at least one "pins" or
     "groups" property,
  2. Keeping "output-high" doesn't work, as the sh-pfc driver does not
     implement PIN_CONFIG_OUTPUT.

Should I fix 1 and/or 2 instead?
