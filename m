The reason is different, the bug is caused by:
	BUG_ON(!map->cache_ops);
in regcache.c

None of the regmap_config have set the .cache_type, so they do not have cache,
so sync is not available for them -> regmap_sync() BUGs out.

It can be fixed by either setting .cache_type for the regmap_config structures
or by removing the resume callback, as it is broken.
