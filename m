True. In this Renasas platform, since the platform doesn't have PSCI
system suspend, we can only support s2idle and not s2ram. In this case
we don't ask platform to enter some system state whereas we suspend all
the devices(leaving wakeup capable devices active) and ask platform to
enter deepest idle state on all the CPUs. I still don't understand the
issue Geert is facing.

Geert, so far you have failed to explain what's different from the new
state you are adding and the existing s2idle.

Exactly, that's what I am trying to convince Geert ;)
