Subject: [PATCH 0/8] ARM: dts: renesas: Remove unit-addresses and regs from integrated caches
Date: Mon,  6 Mar 2017 17:40:35 +0100

	Hi Simon, Magnus,

This patch series removes the bogus unit-addresses and reg properties
from the device nodes representing Cortex-A15/A7 cache controllers.

Note that the latter were added to remove warnings from dtc when using
W=1:

    Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): Node /cache-controller@0 has a unit name, but no reg property

In hindsight, adding the reg properties turned out to be the wrong fix.
Indeed, the Cortex-A15/A7 cache controllers are integrated controllers,
and thus the device nodes representing them should not have
unit-addresses or reg properties.

This series does not have a runtime effect, as Linux doesn't rely much
on the properties of the cache-controller nodes.

This series is the arm32 counterpart of "[PATCH 0/2] arm64: dts: renesas:
Remove unit-addresses and regs from integrated caches", which you've just
applied.

Thanks for applying!

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
