I see, OK.

So it looks like the new driver flag is not really necessary.

The wakeup_path propagation may be done even later, like at the end of
__device_suspend_late(), which is fine, because it is not going to be used
before __device_suspend_noirq() anyway.

Then, drivers can set it from their ->suspend and ->suspend_late callbacks.

Thanks,
Rafael
