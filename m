Subject: [PATCH 0/4] tmio: add support for eMMC with 8 bit bus width
Date: Wed, 14 Sep 2016 19:05:54 +0200

This series enables SDHI instances on R-Car Gen3 to access eMMC with 8 bit bus
width. I think the patch descriptions speak for themselves.

I decided to not protect this new feature with a flag because it needs
specifically to be enabled by setting the bus width to 8. No legacy platform
does that.

The DTS changes for R-Car Gen3 will come via a seperate series. Note that
'non-removable' is not supported yet because of Runtime PM issues. It seems we
need to overhaul Runtime PM handling for other reasons as well, so I suggest
the basic support goes in like this and DTS do not use 'non-removable' for now.

These patches are based on top of Simon's sdr104-v7 patches but they apply to
current mmc/next as well. A branch can be found here:

Please review, comment, apply...
