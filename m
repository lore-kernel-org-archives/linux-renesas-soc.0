Agreed.

But this doesn't look particularly attractive to me, because it would
add a requirement for drivers to implement their system-wide PM
callbacks in a specific way and, in my view, no such requirements
should be imposed by code that advertises itself as "generic" (by the
name at least).  In particular, drivers written to this requirement
might not be able to work correctly with other middle-layer code.

If genpd was a bus type, that wouldn't be particularly objectionable,
even though it is not particularly straightforward either, because
drivers register for a particular bus type and so they need to take
its specifics into account.  Drivers usually don't register for a
specific PM domain, however, and at least some of them may need to
work with different PM domain code on different platforms.

I'm not sure what you mean here.

Drivers in principle should not need to worry about the ->stop|start()
part, because that belongs to a different code layer.

They only need to be able to expect certain things (like clocks) to be
there (or in a specific state) when their code is running in certain
cases.

Now, I realize that this is pure theory and that in practice, if
->stop|start() are there, drivers working with genpd are probably
platform-specific anyway, more or less, so it is not likely that they
will ever have to work with any other middle-layer code.

OK
