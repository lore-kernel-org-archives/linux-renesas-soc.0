Right, I had forgotten about that.
Fortunately the clk-rcar-gen2 driver has a sane failure mode for this case ;-)

it seems the RCAN clock can just be modeled as a fixed clock. However,
its divider value isn't clear to me, as 15.9 MHz cannot be generated from PLL1
using an integer divider. Morimoto-san, can you please ask for clarification?

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
