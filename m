Applied, but this seems to go in the opposite direction of:

846106d9d973 ("ARM: dts: r8a7793: Reduce size of thermal registers")
1af62038f499 ("ARM: dts: r8a7791: Reduce size of thermal registers")
d0191d85a237 ("ARM: dts: r8a7790: Reduce size of thermal registers")

Should those patches be dropped and the register areas grown to 0x100
instead?
