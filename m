In the API I used for the current RZ/A1 BSP, I used an extra parameter
to pass in any non-normal settings.

I would guess for one reason or another, there is always some exception
in the hardware manual when it comes to pins settings. Meaning, there are
restrictions in the I/O pad circuits that the HW designers find it easier
to tell the SW guys to deal with it instead of trying to make it 'automatic=
'
in HW.
So...you'll always have the need for an extra parameter.

As I said, I made "additional configs" a separate parameter, but combining
it with ALTERNATE_FUNC_# is fine with me. I have not seen an SoC that allow=
ed
any more than 8 different functions per pin, so you have lots of bits
in u32 in order to set flags bits.

However, as already mentioned by Geert, "ALTERNATE_FUNC_#" is too long of
a name. Just "ALT_#" is fine.

    renesasa,rz-pins =3D <BANK PORT (ALT_# | IO_MODE | DIRECTION)>;

Geert's suggestion was to just use the actual number (1-8), ALT_# might mak=
e
it easier to decode if you are combining multiple things into a single u32.

There is one more idea....but I heist to suggest it.
You just pass in the port and alternate function number, and you do a looku=
p
table for settings such as bi-direction or port direction register.
You only put into the table the pin settings that are "not normal".

The benefit is that the user doesn't have to know what pins needs what spec=
ial
tweak/flag/setting....but of course it start to make the driver more comple=
x.
