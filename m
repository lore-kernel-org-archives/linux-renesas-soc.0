That makes sense if we consider overlays to be immutable objects that we apply 
without offering a way to modify them. I won't challenge that API decision, as 
my use of an overlay here is a bit of a hack indeed.

Yes, that's something I've identified as well. Lots of work has been done to 
clean up the OF core and we're clearly not done yet. I'm happy to see all the 
improvements you're working on.

Not to allocate the node, no. I allocated the device_node structure manually 
with kzalloc(), and inserted it in the device tree with of_attach_node(). Is 
that the right approach ? I haven't been able to test the code as I stopped 
when I realized I couldn't allocate phandles.

How would you like to proceed ? I can try the manual approach again but need 
information about how I could cleanly implement phandle allocation. I will 
likely then run into other issues for which I might need help.
