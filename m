Subject: [PATCH/RFC 0/4] sh: sh7722/sh7757i/sh7264/sh7269: Fix pinctrl registration

	Hi all,

Magnus reported that on sh7722/Migo-R, pinctrl registration fails with:

    sh-pfc pfc-sh7722: pin 0 already registered
    sh-pfc pfc-sh7722: error during pin registration
    sh-pfc pfc-sh7722: could not register: -22
    sh-pfc: probe of pfc-sh7722 failed with error -22

pinmux_pins[] is initialized through PINMUX_GPIO(), using designated
array initializers, where the GPIO_* enums serve as indices.
Apparently GPIO_PTQ7 was defined in the enum, but never used.
If enum values are defined, but never used, pinmux_pins[] contains
(zero-filled) holes.  Hence such entries are treated as pin zero, which
was registered before, and initialization fails.

I can't see how this ever worked, as at the time of commit f5e25ae52feff2dc
("sh-pfc: Add sh7722 pinmux support"), pinmux_gpios[] in
drivers/pinctrl/sh-pfc/pfc-sh7722.c already had the hole, and
drivers/pinctrl/core.c already had the check.

Some scripting revealed a few more broken drivers:
  - sh7757 has four holes, due to nonexistent GPIO_PT[JLNQ]7_RESV.
  - sh7264 and sh7269 define GPIO_PH[0-7], but don't use it with
    PINMUX_GPIO().

Patch 1 fixes the issue on sh7722, and was tested.
Patches 3-4 should fix the issue on the other 3 SoCs, but was untested due
to lack of hardware.

Thanks for your comments!

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
