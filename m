It's a bit tricky: the dma-ranges properties are walked recursively,
and a PCI bus may be behind a few other bridges that each have a
nontrivial mapping, and the IOMMU may not be on the address space that
the PCI host sees.

In the past, we have said that the dma-ranges property should reflect
the address space that is used when programming the bridge registers
in the PCI host bridge itself.

I think we have also made the assumption that a PCI host bridge
with an IOMMU uses a flat 32-bit DMA address space that goes through
the IOMMU (possibly a separate address space per PCI function,
depending on the type of IOMMU).

One corner case that doesn't really fit in that model is a PCI host
bridge that requires the bridge register to be programmed in a special
way for the IOMMU to work (e.g. away from the RAM to the address that
is routed to the IOMMU).

Another tricky case is a PCI host that uses the IOMMU only for 32-bit
DMA masters but that does have a dma-ranges property that can be
used for direct mapping of all RAM through a nonzero offset that
gets set up according to dma-ranges.

Can you be more specific which of those cases you actually have here?
