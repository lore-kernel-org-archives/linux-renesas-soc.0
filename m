Subject: [PATCH/RFC 0/5] arm64: dts: renesas: Break out common board support
Date: Fri, 21 Apr 2017 14:55:16 +0200

	Hi all,

The Renesas Salvator-X and ULCB development board can be equipped with
either an R-Car H3 or M3-W SiP, which are pin-compatible.  All boards
use separate DTBs, but currently there's no sharing of board-specific
devices in DTS.

This series reduces duplication by extracting common board support into
their own .dtsi files.  As the level of support varies across boards and
SoCs, this requires the addition of a few external clocks and
placeholder devices on R-Car M3-W, so the common board support DTS can
refer to them.

  - Patches 1 and 2 add the external audio and PCIe bus clocks on R-Car
    M3-W, which are present in r8a7795.dtsi, and used in
    r8a7795-salvator-x.dts,
  - RFC patch 3 adds placeholders for devices that are not yet supported
    and/or tested on R-Car M3-W, but used on R-Car H3,
  - RFC patch 4 extracts common Salvator-X board support,
  - RFC patch 5 extracts common ULCB board support.

For R-Car H3 based boards, there are no functional changes.
For R-Car M3-W based boards, some new devices are now described in DT.

Dependencies:
  - renesas-devel-20170420-v4.11-rc7,
  - Patches 1 and 2 can be applied as-is,
  - Patches 4 and 5 depend on "[PATCH 0/8] arm64: dts: renesas: Break
    out R-Car H3 and M3-W SiP"
    (http://www.spinics.net/lists/devicetree/msg173820.html).

DTB changes have been inspected using scripts/dtc/dtx_diff.
This has been tested on Salvator-X (both H3 and M3-W).
This has not been tested on H3ULCB and M3ULCB due to lack of hardware.

Thanks for your comments!
