That patch is relevant, until the MDIO framework is fixed.
It will start to matter more when migrating more (R-Car Gen2) SoCs to the new
CPG/MSSR driver.

It would be good to give that patch some testing on more R-Car Gen2 boards
with NFS root (difficult for me with remote access and network latencies).

After that I can submit it to the irqchip maintainers, as I don't believe MDIO
will be fixed soonish...

Thanks for testing ;-)
