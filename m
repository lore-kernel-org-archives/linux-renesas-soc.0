Subject: [RFC 0/3] mmc: host: tmio: sdio irq improvements

Here is a small series with two minor improvements (patches 1+2) and one bigger
change (patch 3) for SDIO handling with TMIO/SDHI. It is marked as RFC because
I wonder why other drivers are largely not clearing interrupts before enabling
them (patch 3 again). I really think it should be done, but maybe I am missing
something?

Based on mmc/next and tested on Renesas R-Car H3 and M3-W.


Wolfram Sang (3):
  mmc: host: tmio: refactor calls to sdio irq
  mmc: host: tmio: SDIO_STATUS_QUIRK is rather SDIO_STATUS_SETBITS
  mmc: tmio: discard obsolete SDIO irqs before enabling irqs
