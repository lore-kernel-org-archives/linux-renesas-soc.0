    I've looked thru my schematics files and found 3: Rev. 1.1 Update Version 
2, "PORTER_2" Rev. 3.0 Preliminary, and "PORTER_C" Rev. 3.0 Release version!
I'm not sure which of the last 2 should be considered final...

    Yeah, seeing JP13 in the PORTER_C schematics.

    If not earlier. It actually has "Henninger B REV2" printed on it and 
"Porter PCB 1 R3" on a pasted sticker.

    I'm not so sure now...
