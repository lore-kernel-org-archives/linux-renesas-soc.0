Subject: [PATCH v2 0/3] phy: core: Re-work runtime PM deployment and fix an issue
Date: Wed, 20 Dec 2017 15:09:17 +0100
Message-Id: <1513778960-10073-1-git-send-email-ulf.hansson@linaro.org>
Sender: linux-renesas-soc-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-renesas-soc.vger.kernel.org>

Changes in v2:
	- Address scenario, pointed out by Kishon, that runtime PM may be
	enabled by the phy provider driver, *after* it have called
	devm_phy_create() or phy_create().

The intend of this series is to simplify the runtime PM deployment in the phy
core, but while doing that fixing a related problem for a Renesas SoC making use
of a phy. This issue was raised by Geert Uytterhoeven and Yoshihiro Shimoda, due
to a changed behaviour in the runtime PM core.

The commit in question is f8817f61e821 (PM / runtime: Drop children check from
__pm_runtime_set_status()). However, it turned out that the problem existed
already prior this change, only that the error was printed instead of giving a
WARN splat.

More details about the changes are available in each change log. For additional
background, please have look at the link below.
