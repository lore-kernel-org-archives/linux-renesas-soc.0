I think this is partly caused by this commit:

a8c3862551e0 ("pwm: Keep PWM state in sync with hardware state")

But again, we need that one if we don't want to override the current
PWM period with the pwm_args one when the driver support hardware
readout.

This leaves 2 choices:

1/ assign the period to pargs->period if ->get_state() is not
   implemented
2/ remove the !period check in pwm_apply_state() when state->enabled is
   false (do we really care if period = 0 when all we want to do is
   disable the PWM?)

Thierry, what's you're opinion.
