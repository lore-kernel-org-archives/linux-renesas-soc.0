Probably I am missing the point somehow but my understanding is that that
with this and other recent changes these differences are described by DT
properties rather than the compatibility string. In particular the presence
or absence of sd-uhs-sdr50 and sd-uhs-sdr104, and the value of
max-frequency.

Now you mention this I do wonder if sd-uhs-sdr50 and sd-uhs-sdr104 are
SoC properties and thus should be present in r8a7790.dtsi rather than
r8a7790-lager.dts.

I will double check but I think so.
