Do you mean systems where some of the channels of a specific DMA engine=
 go=20
through the IOMMU while others do not ? We indeed have no solution toda=
y for=20
such a situation.

The problem is a bit broader than that, we'll also have an issue with D=
MA=20
engines that have different channels served by different IOMMUs. I reca=
ll=20
discussing this in the past with you, and the solution you proposed was=
 to add=20
a channel index to struct dma_attrs seems good to me. To support the ca=
se=20
where some channels don't go through an IOMMU we would only need suppor=
t for=20
null entries in the IOMMUs list associated with a device (for instance =
in the=20
DT case null entries in the iommus property).

Now I see that struct dma_attrs has been replaced by unsigned long in

    dma-mapping: use unsigned long for dma_attrs

We still have enough bits to reserve some of them for a channel number,=
 but=20
I'm not very happy with that patch as I can see how a future proposal t=
o=20
handle the channel number through the DMA attributes will get rejected =
on the=20
grounds of bits starvation then :-(
