yes, yield the processor when possible, please. So, if your locking
don't really need to disable IRQs, then avoid doing it. If a mutex is
enough, use it.

OK. You could probably leave the (mutex) lock, if you think you need it.
But also consider using usleep_range(1000) instead. Have a look at:
Documentation/timers/timers-howto.txt

for a better explanation.

Ok. If you have the confirmation for that, then it is fine. I just asked
because cases I saw (different manufacturer of course) would have different values
to be programmed, depending on the chip version.

Anyways, just checking.
