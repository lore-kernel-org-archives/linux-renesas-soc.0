Subject: [PATCH v5 00/13] ARM: shmobile: APMU DT support via SMP Enable method

	Hi Simon, Magnus,

This patch series, which I took over from Magnus and extended, adds DT
support for the APMU hardware commonly found in Renesas R-Car Gen2 SoCs.
Without these patches the APMU gets configured through data expressed in
C, and with this series applied it is possible to describe the APMU
configuration in DT and let the enable method point out that the APMU
should be used.

  - Patch 1 documents DT support to describe that the APMU hardware is
    needed for SMP operation,
  - Patch 2 fixes a bug in the rcar-sysc driver that was harmless
    before,
  - Patches 3-5 prepare for handling SYSC interrupt configuration purely
    from DT in the rcar-sysc driver for new SoCs, while preserving
    backward compatibility with old DTBs for R-Car H1, H2, and M2-W,
  - Patch 6 is a small cleanup for CONFIG_SMP=n builds,
  - Patch 7 adds DT support to the APMU driver together with enabling
    use of the enable-method way to describe that the APMU hardware is
    needed for SMP operation,
  - Patches 8-10 make sure that during run-time, if the APMU is
    installed via the DT enable-method then it will not be overriden by
    older non-DT configuration.  To avoid breaking support for older
    DTBs out in the wild these patches keep the older existing C code
    APMU configuration as-is.
  - Patches 11 and 12 update the r8a7790 and r8a7791 DTSes to describe
    the APMU hardware,
  - Patch 13 adds r8a7793 SMP support using the new APMU DT interface.

Magnus suggested making APMU DT configuration mandatory for SMP
operation on newer SoCs and that we keep the old APMU support code in
place for a good number of kernel releases or until we can identify a
couple of major reasons good enough to force a DTB update on the end
users.

This is a prerequisite for adding SMP support for r8a7792 and r8a7794.
Patches updating the DTSes similar to patch 13 - without any C-based SMP
code and fallback - are already floating around.

Note that booting secondary CPUs using renesas,apmu is disabled on all
R-Car Gen2 SoCs if hardware debug mode is enabled through setting
MD21=1, like was done on R-Car M2-W before. While this may not be
necessary on all boards, SoCs, and firmware versions, dropping this
check requires adding some extra handling first.

Changes compared to v4 (more details in the individual patches):
  - Add Acked-by, Reviewed-by,
  - Add missing power-domains property to r8a7793 cpu1 node.

Changes compared to v3 (more details in the individual patches):
  - Use "renesas,<soctype>-apmu" instead of "renesas,apmu-<soctype>",
  - Handle SYSC interrupt configuration purely from DT in the rcar-sysc
    driver for new SoCs,
  - Dropped patch [PATCH v3 04/09] "ARM: shmobile: r8a7793 boot address
    update":
      - Hardcoded SYSCIER value is no longer needed due to the above,
      - ICRAM1 is already used since "ARM: shmobile: rcar-gen2: Use
	ICRAM1 for jump stub on all SoCs",
  - Fix CONFIG_SMP=n build.

This series is against renesas-devel-20160627-v4.7-rc5.
For testing, it's also available in the topic/apmu-dt-v5 branch
of https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/geert/renesas-drivers.git.

This has been tested on r8a7779/marzen, r8a7790/lager, r8a7791/koelsch,
and r8a7793/gose.

Please apply, thanks!
