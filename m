OK, that's new to me - I guess this behaviour was introduced by
b67a8b29df7e ("arm64: mm: only initialize swiotlb when necessary").
Regardless of this patch, that check probably wants fixing to still do
the appropriate thing if arm64_dma_phys_limit is above 4GB (or just
depend on ZONE_DMA). Disabling ZONE_DMA for development doesn't seem
that unreasonable a thing to do, especially if there are ready-made
patches floating around already, so having it crash the kernel in ways
it didn't before isn't ideal.

Thanks for the context. I've done very similar things in the past, and
my first instinct would be to change the default DMA mask in
of_dma_configure() to something which can't reach RAM (e.g. <30 bits),
then instrument dma_set_mask() to catch cleverer drivers. That's a
straightforward way to get 100% coverage - the problem with simply
disabling bounce buffering is that whilst statistically it almost
certainly will catch >95% of cases, there will always be some that it
won't; if some driver only ever does a single dma_alloc_coherent() early
enough that allocations are still fairly deterministic, and always
happens to get a 32-bit address on that platform, it's likely to slip
through the net.

I'm not against the idea of SWIOTLB growing a runtime-disable option,
I'm just not sure what situation it's actually the best solution for.
