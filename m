As mentioned in that thread,the CPGs in r8a7795 and r8a7796 provide
slightly different sets of clocks. Future members of the R-Car Gen3
family may provide the same or different sets of clocks, we don't know.

As Magnus already mentions, we try to stay as close as possible to the
datasheet (which is unfortunately a moving target, too).

For CPG Core Clocks, the datasheet only provides us with a list of named
clocks.  There are no fixed numbers. So either we refer to clocks by
name, or by coming up with our own numbering scheme (which has to be a
stable set of numbers, i.e. append only).

For MSSR (Module) Clocks, the datasheet does provide us with numbers
(MSTP register index + bit index inside the register).

The way the CPG/MSSR drivers handles these clocks was heavily influenced
by the experience we gained with the Common Clock Framework and DT on
R-Car Gen2.

R-Car Gen2 described all clocks and their registers in DT. The goal
(utopia?) here was to handle all SoCs from the family with a single
driver, provided it was fed with the right description in DT.

For CPG Core Clocks, this lead to a mix of:
  - Nodes for fixed factor clocks,
  - Nodes for variable factor clocks, specifying a register to operate
    on,
  - Special CPG clocks that couldn't be handled by the above, using a
    common (family-specific) list of definitions for clocks, that had to
    be extended constantly.

For MSSR Clocks (called "MSTP" for historical reasons), each set of 32
clocks had its own node, with multiple registers, and three separate
arrays for parent clocks, clock indices, and clock names, that had to be
kept in sync. The clock indices were defines, using numbers from the
datasheet, but they were still easy to abuse (which register does the
define apply to?).

As the CCF was quite new and best practices were still under
development, all of this was difficult to define up-front.
Due to the complexity, it was also hard to review and maintain, leading
to many errors.
The arbitrary (grown organically) offsets for the various MSSR-related
registers also made it hard to ever add module reset support.

Hence the call for a new framework, designed in close collaboration with the
clock maintainer, and implemented in the CPG/MSSR driver.
The goals were:
  - Make the DT part user friendly, reviewer friendly, and maintainer
    friendly, as it provides a stable ABI, and thus must be obviously
    correct from the beginning,
  - Hide complexity and internals in the driver, as this can be reworked
    and extended at any time, without breaking the DT ABI,
  - Hence, describe CPG/MSSR as a single simple block in DT,
  - Support both new and existing SoCs (PoC was done for r8a7791),
  - Allow for adding module reset support (the "SR" part) later.

Hence for the CPG Core Clocks, we wanted a simple append-only list of
defines for all clocks (and only those, as trying to use another clock
is a bug) that exist on a specific SoC. This allows to list all existing
clocks in the bindings include up-front.
A mapping from SoC-specific numbers to family-specific clocks is handled
by the tables in the driver, to promote code reuse while keeping
specialization.

For MSSR Clocks, we solved the disconnection of register and bit indices
by going with a single number. We also removed the defines, as it's
actually easier to review .dtsi updates if the MSSR clocks are directly
referred to by number, than by an intermediate define.

I hope this explanation helps in understanding the design choices we
made.  Given the small amount of work needed to bootstrap r8a7796, I
think they still hold on their promises.

Thanks!

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

                        Geert
