Great. Thanks for the review!

Fine with me. I feel much more comfortable with your experience backing
up ours.

The throughput numbers of 'dd' are exactly the same. But maybe I could

I'll check. I also identified this tasklet as the next target but I
haven't actually looked into it yet.

Thanks for looking into it right away,
