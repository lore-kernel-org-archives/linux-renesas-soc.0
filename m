Right, and that's what I hear all the time, but it's not really an
argument that stacks up.

We have the big "ARM system type" choice, one of the options there is
to build for multi-platform.  Historically, it's been to select the
SoC family - where "SoC family" means a group of SoCs that could be
built together into one image without all the fun and games of V:P
patching, auto-zreladdr, etc - _exactly_ the conditions that !MMU
and XIP_KERNEL depended upon[*].

To allow a SOC to be built without multiplatform, you add another
option to that choice statement (exactly as we used to have before
multiplatform).  For the sake of argument, let's say we're talking
about iMX ARMv7 SoCs.  So, let's call it ARM_SOC_IMX_V7.

You add to that all the select statements that multiplatform gives
you that you need for that platform, omitting those that don't make
sense (like virt/phys patching), making it depend on XIP_KERNEL and/or
!MMU.

Then you change the mach-*/Kconfig entry like this:

menuconfig ARCH_MXC
-       bool "Freescale i.MX family"
-       depends on ARCH_MULTI_V4_V5 || ARCH_MULTI_V6_V7 || ARM_SINGLE_ARMV7M
+       bool "Freescale i.MX family" if !ARM_SOC_IMX_V7
+       depends on ARCH_MULTI_V4_V5 || ARCH_MULTI_V6_V7 || ARM_SINGLE_ARMV7M ||\
+		ARM_SOC_IMX_V7
+	default ARM_SOC_IMX_V7

and also modify the if ARCH_MULTI_V7 to also allow that section if
ARM_SOC_IMX_V7 is enabled.


* - that's the problem - multiplatform went head-long into the "we
don't like the existing solution, we need to move everyone away, and
let's hope no one wants XIP_KERNEL or !MMU now".  So we went from a
relatively good solution that didn't support building diverse platforms
together to one that rather sucks for XIP_KERNEL and !MMU.
