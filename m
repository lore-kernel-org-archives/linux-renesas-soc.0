Correct. The pin controller hardware in RZ/A(1) devices configures pin
functions per-pin and not per-group as the SH/R-Car family does.

There has been an attempt to support this platforms with the existing
sh-pfc/ infrastructure in the past (https://lwn.net/Articles/573222/)
which I re-proposed for v4.9, but that driver simply does not fit
this hardware which is different from the one found in R-Car
devices.

More on the background of this series in this email thread:
https://marc.info/?l=linux-gpio&m=148536779917834&w=2

I initially created a whole new sub-directory where all the Renesas
devices with this kind of pin controller would have gone
(drivers/pinctrl/rz-pfc) but since as of now the only available
hardware of that type is RZ/A1 and some of its variants, we decided to go
with a single driver supporting that platform only.
If more will come, we'll think about supporting them through this
driver if possible, or create a dedicated directory.

Are you ok with this?

Thanks
