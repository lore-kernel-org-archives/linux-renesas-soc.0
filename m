Subject: [PATCH mmc/next] mmc: sh_mmcif: Document r8a73a4, r8a7779 and sh73a0 DT bindings
Date: Thu, 24 Nov 2016 19:17:15 +0100

Simply document new compatibility strings as the driver is already
activated using a fallback compatibility string.

These compat strings are in keeping with those for all other
Renesas ARM based SoCs with sh_mmcif enabled in mainline.

I plan to follow-up with patches to use these new compat strings
to bring the DT files of the SoCs in question in-line with those
for other Renesas ARM based SoCs with sh_mmcif enabled in mainline.
