Subject: [PATCH] PM / Runtime: Only force-resume device if it has been force-suspended
Date: Thu,  3 Mar 2016 22:16:54 +0200
Message-Id: <1457036214-26136-1-git-send-email-laurent.pinchart+renesas@ideasonboard.com>
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-renesas-soc.vger.kernel.org>

The pm_runtime_force_suspend() and pm_runtime_force_resume() helpers are
designed to help driver being RPM-centric by offering an easy way to
manager runtime PM state during system suspend and resume. The first
function will force the device into runtime suspend at system suspend
time, while the second one will perform the reverse operation at system
resume time.

However, the pm_runtime_force_resume() really forces resume, regarding
of whether the device was running or already suspended before the call
to pm_runtime_force_suspend(). This results in devices being runtime
resumed at system resume time when they shouldn't.

Fix this by recording whether the device has been forcefully suspended
in pm_runtime_force_suspend() and condition resume in
pm_runtime_force_resume() to that state.

All current users of pm_runtime_force_resume() call the function
uncontionally in their system resume handler (some actually set it as
the resume handler), all after calling pm_runtime_force_suspend() at
system suspend time. The change in behaviour should thus be safe.
