Subject: [PATCH/RFT v3 0/3] thermal: add support for r8a77995

This series adds thermal support for r8a77995.
R-Car D3 (r8a77995) have a thermal sensor module which is similar to Gen2.
Therefore this series adds r8a77995 support to rcar_thermal driver not
rcar_gen3_thermal driver.

This series is based on the next branch of Zhang Rui's linux tree.

v3 [Yoshihiro Kaneko]
* As suggested by Geert Uytterhoeven
rcar_thermal.c:
- make use_of_thermal in structure rcar_thermal_chip a single bit
- add feature bits to rcar_thermal_chip
- add the number of interrupts to rcar_thermal_chip
- remove rcar_thermal_type in rcar_thermal_cip
- make variable chip in rcar_thermal_probe() a const

rcar-thermal.txt:
* No change

r8a77995.dtsi:
* No change


v2 [Yoshihiro Kaneko]
* As suggested by Geert Uytterhoeven
rcar_thermal.c:
- remove rcar_of_data macro
- store a pointer to rcar_thermal_chip in rcar_thermal_priv
- remove unnecessary cast in rcar_thermal_dt_ids

rcar-thermal.txt:
- drop the fallback for D3
- update the paragraph about interrupts

r8a77995.dtsi:
- fix the base address and the register addresses
- drop the fallback
