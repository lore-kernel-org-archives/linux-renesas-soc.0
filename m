That's the standard (highest number of occurrences) way.

This one is special: it's basically an M3-N prototype board made by taking
a Salvator-X/M3-W board, and replacing the M3-W SiP by an M3-N SiP.
Hence the board part number is the same.

AFAIU, "Salvator-XS" really means "Salvator-X 2nd version".
So it's not "Version", but "Alternative Board Name".
There's a similar thing with the ULCB boards:

  - H3ULCB (R-Car Starter Kit Premier, RTP0RC7795SKBX0010SA00 (H3 ES1.1))
    H3ULCB (R-Car Starter Kit Premier, RTP0RC77951SKBX010SA00 (H3 ES2.0))
  - M3ULCB (R-Car Starter Kit Pro, RTP0RC7796SKBX0010SA09 (M3 ES1.0))

I'm afraid not. Naming seems to become only more complex over time...
Unless you have great hands and great ideas ;-)
