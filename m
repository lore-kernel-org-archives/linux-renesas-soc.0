Not exactly related to buttons and leds,
but recently I came across another usecase of shared gpio,

Say, for example, we have multiple external I2C peripheral which share
interrupt line over gpio (ofcourse irq line is muxed onto single gpio).

Now in kernel I would have multiple instances of driver supporting each
peripheral but gpio can not be shared for registering irq.

Do you suggest MFD driver for such simple usecases ? Should gpiolib
support SHARED gpios, and gpiolib can define all the policies over
configuration (input only, what about conflicts, bidirectional mode?)

Thanks,
Vaibhav
