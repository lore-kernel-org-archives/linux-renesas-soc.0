I've re-checked rcar-pcie hardware documentation.

It indeed mentions that AXI bus it sits on is 32-bit.

With my patch applied and thus 32bit dma_mask set for NVMe device, I do
see high addresses passed to dma_map_*() routines and handled by
swiotlb. Thus your statement that behavior "succeed 64bit dma_set_mask()
operation but silently replace mask behind the scene" is required for
swiotlb to be used, does not match reality.

It can be interpreted as a breakage elsewhere, but it's hard to point
particular "root cause". The entire infrastructure to allocate and use
DMA memory is messy.

Still current code does not work, thus fix is needed.

Perhaps need to introduce some generic API to "allocate memory best
suited for DMA to particular device", and fix allocation points (in
drivers, filesystems, etc) to use it. Such an API could try to allocate
area that can be DMAed by hardware, and fallback to other memory that
can be used via swiotlb or other bounce buffer implementation.

But for now, have to stay with dma masks. Will follow-up with a patch
based on your but with coherent mask handling added.

Nikita
