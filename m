Thanks for your suggestion, the nvmem API indeed looks like a suitable API,
as it does support read-only nvmems.

Unfortunately I also see a few disadvantages:
  1. nvmem_init() is a subsys_initcall(), while most of our users (except for
     the recent renesas-cpg-mssr driver) are clock drivers using
     CLK_OF_DECLARE(), and are thus initialized from of_clk_init() at much
     earlier time_init() time.
     Of course the mvmem subsystem and/or the clock drivers can be changed, if
     deemed useful.
  2. Using the nvmem DT bindings means we have to add more DT glue from the
     nvmem consumer(s) to the nvmem provider. As we need to provide backwards
     compatibility with old DTSes, this means we need more C code or DT fixup
     code to handle that.
  3. The nvmem subsystem may be overkill to provide access to a simple 32-bit
     read-only register that never changes value after boot.

Thoughts?
