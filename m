But now you are mixing up syntax and semantics.

You are describing what steps are necessary on this hardware to
apply a certain setting. That is fine, if you didn't need any specific
semantics there, you could be using pinctrl-single which will just
hammer stuff into registers, one register per pin. You have a pin
controller driver exactly beacause your hardware has semantics.

How this is described in the device tree or a board file is a different
thing from how you write your driver.

I understand why i makes for easier code, but does it make for more
generic and understandable device trees for people maintaining
several systems? I don't think so.

The benefit is clearly abstraction, standardization and readability of the
device tree. I, as developer, understand what is going on electrically,
having seen this on other systems, and being able to access generic
documentation on generic pin config properties.

Very little more complex, and actually it could be argued that this
is exactly why subnodes exist: to be able to have different pin config
on pins. I think it is very readable.

I have seen so much stuff that people say is "necessarily different"
for their platform. It turns our that silicon IO and solid state physics
isn't that much different between systems. The same things invariably
pop up in several chips.

Hell this was what people said about this whole subsystem from the
beginning: pin control is so necessarily different that there is no point
in trying to create an abstraction for it.

If I had listened to that kind of advice we wouldn't be where we are today.

And that said, I have already pointed out that two of them already
exist in the pin control subsystem (PIN_CONFIG*). Because other SoCs
are doing similar things.

I understand they can be made more beautiful, but in my view
that is putting make up on a pig, I want generic pin config for these
things.

See "GPIO mode pitfalls" in Documentation/pinctrl.txt
I've been over this hardware lingo so many times already.

It is not about "GPIO" at all, it is about pin configuration. The
generic pin config was not invented for GPIO, it was just recently
that we started to provide pin config back-ends for GPIO. Only
Intel do that so far.

And that is a driver semantic. Or even a subsystem semantic. No
big deal, accumulate such writes in the driver and apply it all when you have
it all available no matter if pin multiplexing or pin config happens first?
Surely this is just a hardware pecularity, then it warrants some special
driver code.

If you definately feel you must get a call from the pin control core setting
up muxing and config at the same time we need to think of a way to
augment the pin control core if necessary?

The fact that Linux pin control subsystem semantics you don't
like does not affect the relevant device tree bindings.
