However, there is a convention, documented in the kerneldoc comment of
device_init_wakeup(), by which devices participating in system wakeup
"passively" (like USB controllers and hubs) are expected to have it
enabled by default.

If that convention was followed by the devices in question here, the
wakeup_path bit would be set for them and no other code changes would
be necessary.  So is there any reason for not following it?

Thanks,
Rafael
