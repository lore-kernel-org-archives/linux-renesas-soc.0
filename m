I think so, it's the link that goes into L1 state and this can happen
without any action from the controller side.

Is there some hardware which I can use to simulate this situation ?

I went through the latest errata sheet and don't see anything. The
datasheet only mentions that L0/L0s/L1 is supported and L2 is not supported.

Maybe Phil can comment on this too ?
