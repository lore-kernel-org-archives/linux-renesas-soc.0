I am fine with that, I don't see any issue having them as they are
static values and highly unlikely to change and hence no threat to
backward compatibility.

The main concern I had with latency values is that it's currently not
used anywhere but if we decide to use say in secure software, having the
untested/early values in DT might cause compatibility issues in future
as they were added much before the actual understanding of it's usage.
So I prefer to defer them until then.
