The problem is that even though they are pre-production, these are out
there and in active use, e.g. kernelci is at least doing automated
testing on one of those in Kevins lab and should be an additional
soonish in the Collabora lab. 

And for developers it'll be extra fun if halfway through a bisect the
dts name changes..

Having a es2 in your dtb name might be a bit quirky, but it's really
just a name without other meaning :).

Heh yeah, i'd expect we'd have a mixed environment for quite a while
given these boards are a bit too expensive to just throw in the trash..
