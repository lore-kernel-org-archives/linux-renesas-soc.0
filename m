Subsystems/driver that uses pm_runtime_force_suspend|resume() don't
necessarily need to have their devices attached to a genpd. In such
cases, $subject patch will be an improvement by itself.

Me personally would rather skip the intermediate step you propose, as
I prefer to properly change genpd with what is needed. Moreover, I am
already working on that so it shouldn't take too long before I can
post some patches.

Kind regards
