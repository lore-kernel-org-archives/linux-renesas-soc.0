No worries at all!
And thank you for getting back to me.

Good point!
Maybe if this patch explicitly tested for -EPROBE_DEFER the maintenance
of mmc_regulator_get_supply would be easier as all of the drivers behaved
similarly.
On the other hand, both "vmmc" and "vqmmc" are considered optional by
mmc_regulator_get_supply, therefore their absence is tolerated (0 is
returned), and as you said the only other possible value returned by
mmc_regulator_get_supply is -EPROBE_DEFER.
If in the future the logic of mmc_regulator_get_supply changes, I guess
even the driver needs to adapt as there may be something wrong with the
regulators, therefore I personally rather the driver to bail out whatever
the error returned by mmc_regulator_get_supply. Looking at the history
of the other drivers I couldn't spot any meaningful comment connected
to the return value of mmc_regulator_get_supply.

I guess you are right! ;)

Ulf, what's the best option here?

Kind regards,
Fabrizio
