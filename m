I did not follow too much.
But it seems IMX7ULP/Vybrid to be also a fan of generic
output-enable/input-enable
property.

See:
Figure 5-2. GPIO PAD in Page 241
http://www.nxp.com/assets/documents/data/en/reference-manuals/VFXXXRM.pdf

It has separate register bits to control input buffer enable and
output buffer enable
and we need set it property for GPIO function.
