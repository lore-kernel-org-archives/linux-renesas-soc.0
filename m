That is the problem I was referring to above: the dma-ranges property
contents depend on whether the IOMMU is used or not, and that
is not something you know in the DT, because it depends on the OS.

Ok, so you map the second 1GB of PCI space into the second 1GB of AXI
space, which presumably is also the first 1GB of the physical RAM
at CPU address 0x00000000, correct?

Does this mean the IOMMU virtual address space covers the entire 4GB
of low addresses, or is it a subset of that space, e.g. the first
1GB, below where the PCI bus sees the RAM?

It doesn't apply since the 32-bit limitation you see is part of the
PCI host bridge, not a limitation of some PCI devices.
