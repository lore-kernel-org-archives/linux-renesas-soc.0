Ok; I understand what's happening, then.

FWIW, the warnings are benign, albeit annoying.

I'll have a go at cleaning this up.

No worries.

Ok.

That's stating that the DTB doesn't provide a interrupt-affinity
property for the PMU nodem so the affinity is guessed based on the
logical CPU ordering, which is dodgy.

I can see that's missing in arch/arm/boot/dts/sh73a0.dtsi.

That should be easy to fix up, as per
arch/arm64/boot/dts/renesas/r8a7795.dtsi, assuming you're aware of which
IRQ corresponds to which CPU.

Thanks,
Mark.
