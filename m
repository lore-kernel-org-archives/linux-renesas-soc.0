There are different "resumes" here, so this gets a bit tricky to
discuss around. Let me give it another try.

First, let's assume we have a card inserted, initialized and tuned.
This also means we have a cache of tuning (tap) values in the host.

When the *host* runtime PM suspends, which isn't related to when the
card suspends, typically the card remains powered/initialized. Then,
when the host runtime PM resumes the tuning values can be restored in
the host controller, as those should still be working because the card
has remained initialized.

When the card system PM suspends, the card will be put to sleep/power
off (can_retune == 0). Sooner or later the host also becomes runtime
PM suspended in this sequence.

When the card system PM resumes, the card will be woken up from sleep,
power on and the re-initializations starts. Before the
re-initializations starts, the host will be runtime PM resumed, but
since can_retune == 0, no tuning values will be restored (correct).
When the re-initialization sequence completes of the card, can_retune
== 1 as a new tuning sequence has also been completed. This also means
refreshed cached tunings values in the host, which it can use the next
time it will be runtime PM resumed.

Hope this made more sense now.
