not long ago I thought with a few colleagues about this. The scenario is
to start a Linux kernel on a Cortex-M companion to a Cortex-A.

The ideal solution I imagine is to make the other CPU's OS a consumer of
the Linux clock driver. This would require a generic device driver on the
companion CPU that forwards clk requests via inter-cpu communication to
the Linux clk driver. It could be feed with the necessary information by
the rproc glue. So when the companion cpu is supposed to care for the
can0 device, the steps that should happen are:

 - make sure can0 isn't occupied by the Linux Host
 - reroute the can irq to the companion cpu (if necessary)
 - create a dtb containing something like this for the companion CPU:

 	clks: virtclk {
		compatible = ???
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		...
	};

	can@$address {
		compatible = ...
		regs = ...
		clocks = <&clks 3>;
		clock-names = ...
		...
	};

   where the driver binding to the virtclk device just forwards clk
   requests to the Linux host side which then knows that clk 3 is the
   can clock and does the necessary stuff.

This way the can clock doesn't need special handling in the host's dtb
and no clock necessary for the companion is disabled as unused because
it is requested and enabled.

The only problem I see is that implementing such a driver/protocol
probably is time consuming.

Best regards
Uwe
