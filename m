This is not about powering off the system, but about suspending the system,
which suspends all drivers.

The issue is that the normal workqueue may run while the system is being
suspended.  Accessing the DA9062 may or may not work at that time,
depending on the i2c controller being usable or not.

Due to the DA9062 being an i2c device, I agree this is different than
for rcar-thermal, where the rcar-thermal device itself cannot be
accessed because it is suspended.

The main thing to test is what happens when da9062_thermal_poll_on() is
called while the i2c controller is already suspended, and whether that
is mitigated by my patch.
Looking at the function, I guess it starts spewing error messages, and
will continue triggering itself, by virtue of enabling the interrupt again,
without having been able to disable its cause.
