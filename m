Sounds like this is solvable.

Ah I wasn't aware we were keeping backwards compatibility around.

The nvmem subsystem is designed to read values from things that
mostly never change. Overkill may be true, but the nice thing
about using nvmem APIs is that the driver doesn't have to use
some platform specific function that duplicates similar
functionality. It's unfortunate that backwards incompatibility
limits our ability to move to common linux frameworks when they
are created after the binding is used.
