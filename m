Technically yes, it was part of the 2/2 until now.

The GyroADC block is a reduced SPI block with up to 8 chipselect lines,
which supports the SPI protocol of a selected few SPI ADCs. The SPI ADCs
are sampled by the GyroADC block in a round-robin fashion and the result
presented in the GyroADC registers.

Good ?

It's enumerated below , the only special-case we handle at this point is
the r8a7792 , which has extra interrupt block which we don't use anyway,
but the driver disables those interrupts.

I can add .... otherwise use the matching SoC model in <chip> field.

1, up-to 4 or up-to 8, depending on the ADC you connect.

I guess it can be made mandatory as not having any ADC attached would
make it pretty pointless to enable this block in the first place ...
