Subject: [PATCH 0/5] ARM: dts: rcar-gen2: Convert to new CPG/MSSR bindings

	Hi Simon, Magnus,

Currently Renesas R-Car Gen2 SoCs use the common clk-rcar-gen2,
clk-mstp, and clk-div6 drivers, which depend on most clocks being
described in DT.  Especially the module (MSTP) clocks are cumbersome and
error prone, due to 3 arrays (clocks, clock-indices, and
clock-output-names) to be kept in sync. In addition, the clk-mstp driver
cannot be extended easily to also support module resets, which are
provided by the same hardware module.

Hence when developing support for R-Car Gen3 SoCs, another approach was
chosen, which led to the CPG/MSSR driver core, and SoC-specific
subdrivers (initially for R-Car Gen3, but later also for RZ/G1).

This series complements the series "[PATCH v2 00/10] clk: renesas:
rcar-gen2: Add new CPG/MSSR drivers", and converts the various R-Car
Gen2 DTSes to migrate to the new CPG/MSSR drivers.

Note that module reset descriptions will be added later.

Dependencies:
  - This has a hard dependency on "[PATCH v2 00/10] clk: renesas:
    rcar-gen2: Add new CPG/MSSR drivers", which is planned to be queued
    for v4.13.
    Hence this series must _not_ be applied before v4.13-rc1!
  - To avoid a small but harmless regression (Ethernet PHY falling back
    to polling instead of using its IRQ), "of_mdio: Fix broken PHY IRQ
    in case of probe deferral" should be applied first.

For testing, this patch series, incl. all dependencies, are available in
the topic/rcar2-cpg-mssr-v2 branch of my renesas-drivers git repository
at
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/geert/renesas-drivers.git.

This has been tested on r8a7790/lager, r8a7791/koelsch, r8a7792/blanche,
r8a7793/gose, and r8a7794/alt.  /sys/kernel/debug/clk/clk_summary has
been compared before and after the conversion.

Thanks!
