Instantiate the thermal sensor in the r8a7794 device tree.

Based on very similar work for the r8a7790 by Magnus Damm.

Hi Morimoto-san,

as discussed briefly last week I am having some trouble enabling thermal
for the r8a7794/alt. With this patch applied on top of
renesas-devel-20160127-v4.5-rc1 I see:

# dmesg | grep thermal
[    1.089897] rcar_thermal e61f0000.thermal: thermal sensor was broken
[    1.101225] rcar_thermal: probe of e61f0000.thermal failed with error -22

I also see this with "[PATCH] thermal: core: don't call unsupported trip on
thermal_tripped_notify()" applied.

Is this a kernel issue that you are aware of?
Is there a possibility that there is a problem with my hardware?

Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

AFIK this is not urgent.
