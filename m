Subject: [PATCH v5 00/10] Renesas RZ/A1 pin and gpio controller
Date: Thu, 27 Apr 2017 10:19:44 +0200

Hi Geert,
   this is 5th round of gpio/pincontroller for RZ/A1 devices.

I have updated the pin controller driver to use the newly introduced
"pinctrl_enable()" function.
This is required since v4.11-rc7 as otherwise, as reported by Chris Brandt,
the pin controller does not start.

I have incorporated your comments on the device tree bindings documentation,
and added to pinctrl-generic.h header file two macros to unpack generic
properties and their arguments.

Tested with SCIF, RIIC, ETHER and gpio-leds on Genmai board.

Thanks
   j

v1 -> v2:
- change pin configuration flags as suggested by Chris
- gpio set direction function fixed as suggested by Chris
- add some more example on pin configuration flag usage to dt-binding doc
- fix gpio-controller names to remove unit address as suggested by Geert
- some comments chopped here and there to make the driver less verbose

v2 -> v3:
- fix grammar and syntax in comment and documentation
- fix code style (reverse xmas tree ordering in variable declaration)
- use irqsave/irqrestore in spinlock lock/unlock
- use devm_ version of kasprintf (memory returned was not properly free)
- use bitops.h operation ffs and fls to make sure a single bit is set in pmx
  mask
- Add Geert's reviewed-by to DTS patches

v3 -> v4:
- use "pinmux" property in pmx sub-nodes in place of "renesas,pins"
- use pinconf standard properties to set pin mux additional flags
- add "bi-directional" and "output-enable" to pinconf generic properties
- perform pmx function parsing at dt_node_to_map() time
- change DT bindings to use GENERIC_PINCONF
- change DT bindings to allow sub-nodes to have "pinmux" property specified
- several renames (register names, DT parse functions, set_mux() function)

v4 -> v5:
- use pinctrl_enable() function in pin controller registration function
- update bindings documentation to incorporate Geert's comments
- add generic properties unpack macros

  arm: dts: r7s72100: Add pin controller node
  arm: dts: genmai: Add SCIF2 pin group
  arm: dts: genmai: Add RIIC2 pin group
  arm: dts: genmai: Add user led device nodes
  arm: dts: genmai: Add ethernet pin group
