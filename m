Subject: [PATCH v3 00/06] iommu/ipmmu-vmsa: IPMMU multi-arch update V3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-renesas-soc.vger.kernel.org>

iommu/ipmmu-vmsa: IPMMU multi-arch update V3

[PATCH v3 01/06] iommu/ipmmu-vmsa: Remove platform data handling
[PATCH v3 02/06] iommu/ipmmu-vmsa: Rework interrupt code and use bitmap for context
[PATCH v3 03/06] iommu/ipmmu-vmsa: Break out utlb parsing code
[PATCH v3 04/06] iommu/ipmmu-vmsa: Break out domain allocation code
[PATCH v3 05/06] iommu/ipmmu-vmsa: Add new IOMMU_DOMAIN_DMA ops
[PATCH v3 06/06] iommu/ipmmu-vmsa: Drop LPAE Kconfig dependency

These patches update the IPMMU driver with a couple of changes
to support build on multiple architectures. In the process of
doing so the interrupt code gets reworked and the foundation
for supporting multiple contexts are added.

In this version of the series the patch order has been reworked
to make simplify review. Thanks to Laurent for his suggestions!

The 32-bit ARM logic has intentionally been changed as little as possible
to avoid breakage. Once CONFIG_IOMMU_DMA can be used it may be good time
to revisit the init ordering for the 32-bit SoCs. There is room for
improvement for sure like Robin Murphy kindly pointed out.

Changes since V2:
 - Got rid of patch 3 from the V2 however patch 1, 2 and 4 are kept.
 - V3 patch 3, 4 and 5 come from
   [PATCH 00/04] iommu/ipmmu-vmsa: IPMMU CONFIG_IOMMU_DMA update
 - Patch 5 has been reworked to include patch 3 of the V1 of this series 

Changes since V1:
 - Got rid of patch 2 and 3 from initial series
 - Updated bitmap code locking and also used lighter bitop functions
 - Updated the Kconfig bits to apply on top of ARCH_RENESAS
