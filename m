The on-SoC devices (all under the /soc node, except for the weird ones without
reg properties that are now being moved out) all have "&gic" as their interrupt
parents.

Off-SoC devices use one of the on-SoC interrupt controllers for external
interrupts ("&irqc", "&irqpin", "&irqpin0", "&irqpin1"), or one of the on-SoC
GPIO controllers that can also serve external interrupts ("&gpioN").

For the latter, I think interrupts-extended definitely makes sense.

For the former (incl. the "pmu_aN" nodes discussed here), it is debatable.
But using interrupts-extended makes it easier to catch mistakes in board files,
as they will be flagged by dtc ("Missing interrupt-parent").
With interrupt-parent in the root node, they may go undetected.

If the tools can help us, I prefer to use them.

Do you agree?

Thanks!
