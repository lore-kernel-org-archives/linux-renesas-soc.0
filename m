There has been some discussion in this thread already. I would like to
provide some more information in case it is useful.

The 3.5.0 BSP appears to contain several that may be relevant to this
discussion:

383c4437846d mmc: sh_mobile_sdhi: Add detecting a change point of data to SCC tuning
1823812e0937 mmc: tmio: Add detecting a change point of data to SCC tunin
03935e9182d9 mmc: tmio: Fix tuning flow
c711db03349c mmc: sh_mobile_sdhi: Fix sampling clock position selecting
2838a2ff8ca7 mmc: tmio: fix soft lockup on CMD12 for R-Car SDHI


Of these, so far I have looked into "mmc: tmio: Fix tuning flow".
It seems to do several things:

- Ensure tuning initialisation is called for each tuning procedure:
  this seems a correct fix for a bug added by me
- Do not terminate tuning on error:
  this is not my reading of the documentation but may well be correct
- Reset more:
  I am least sure about this as it does not seem to have any explanation
  in the changelog
