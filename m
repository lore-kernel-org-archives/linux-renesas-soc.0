???

You suggest to use 'completely ridiculous' definitions in favor to 
definitions that have a proper name space RCANFD_ ?

When there is a more readable way that maintains proper readable code 
there's no reason to adopt crappy definitions just because some chip 
designer has no clue how to design proper register names.

When there's some mapping from RSCFDnCFDCmFDCFG to RCANFD_DCFG_* this 
could be mentioned in the comments.

But I'm totally against these blurry upper/lower case letter stuff for 
register definitions.
