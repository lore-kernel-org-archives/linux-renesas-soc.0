That would be saner, I agree.

And a much saner way of doing this would be, in my understanding, not 
using the group-based sh-pfc drivers used for R-Car and back it up with 
a pin-based equivalent, where to hook drivers for each specific hardware.

Looks like pinmux-single, yes, but that driver bets on the ability to 
set pin functions and configurations with a write to a single register 
while, at least for RZ/A, the same is scattered among several registers 
(I may be wrong on the single register requirement for pinctrl-single 
though)

So, I guess what direction to take depends on whether or not we're going 
to see more hardware with a per-pin configuration that would benefit 
from this new rz-pfc driver (it seems so) and if this justify splitting 
sh-pfc in two, a group-based one for R-Car devices (and all devices 
there already) and a new pin-based one.

Or maybe we can tie pin-based configuration in sh-pfc and it's me not 
seeing how to do that.

Thanks
