Don't you? The external clock inputs are at the root of the clock tree, so I'd
say you need them. Bolting them on later may become complicated, especially
if you care about DTB backwards compatibility.

The reset controller subsystem is optional anyway, and used only by a small
number of drivers, so support for resets can definitely be postponed.

I had a quick glance. Looks OK mostly, so it's definitely heading for the right
direction!
One remaining question: do you need CLK_OF_DECLARE()?
Is there any reason your clock driver cannot be a platform driver, which is
the recommended way?

Thanks!
