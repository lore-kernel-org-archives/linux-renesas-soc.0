Correct.

I understand your suggested approach and it may work.

I guess so.

Still, the error report by Geert worries me, but I don't think it
worth to speculate, but rather test and see.

Agree.

Well, my guesses is that would be a step to make the behavior a bit
more deterministic and perhaps less fragile than today.

On the other hand, I am also concerned about the future users of the
->stop|start() callbacks, including related drivers dealing with the
affected devices. That in a sense, that converting the code in genpd
to what you suggest, would still not encourage related drivers to
behave correctly during system suspend/resume. Then down the road,
when additional new users of the ->stop|start() callbacks may have
been added, it may be even harder to drop calling them in from the
noirq phases.

So to conclude, I would prefer to drop calling
pm_runtime_force_suspend|resume() from genpd, without a replacement,
but I am willing to accept also your suggested alternative.

Kind regards
Uffe
