I don't have schematics for this board, but you told me it's very similar to
Porter. Hence I'd expect "scif0_data_d" instead.

In my experience, when changing pinctrl to map the lines of a device to a new
set of pins, but not mapping another device to the old set of pins, it may
output the signals on both the old and the new set of pins.

Does serial console input work with "scif0_data"?
