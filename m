The first sentence is a bit backwards, I'd rephrase like so:

Multiple times now we've had the request to access devices very late, when
interrupts are no longer available.

accidentally

"Same" (with capital 'S') to match the other entries. Also, should it
not be @master_xfer to help the tools do the right thing?

Trailing period.

I'm fine with this change, but should it not wait until there is a user?
(I think there is one in the wings, so that's a very weak objection...)
