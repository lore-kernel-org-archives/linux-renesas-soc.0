I think it's working fine in renesas-drivers, isn't it?

As in the mean time the R-Car Gen3 CPG/MSSR drivers gained suspend/resume
support, the only missing part is support for restoring the Z* clocks durin=
g
system resume.  Unless that is handled automatically by the cpufreq core.
For secondary CPU cores, this may be handled by the CPU hotplug code.
For the primary CPU core, I don't know.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
