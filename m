Yes, I was working on it recently.
I suppose we should coordinate these things in future to avoid
duplicated effort.

I did not entirely get to the bottom of the problem, but I think that at
the very least something needs to be done about the for_each_rsnd_src()
loop in rsnd_src_probe.

My, obviously not satisfactory, hack around there being no src0 was as follows.
