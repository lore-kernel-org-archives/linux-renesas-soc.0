Thanks for checking the code and sorry to disappoint you by not using
->ids[] and ->num_ids right away. The two-drivers-on-one approach
comes from wanting to use the same IOMMU driver on both 32-bit and
64-bit ARM architectures but the former is lacking IOMMU_DMA support
upstream.

Obviously using ->ids[] and ->num_ids is the right forward, and in my
mind it is only a question of time and merge order. I'm more than
happy to make use of your patch but I'm wondering if it will work on
32-bit ARM and R-Car Gen2 that currently does not use ->of_xlate(). I
can see that you're using iommu_fwspec_init() so it might work right
out of the box. Thanks for your help cooking up the patch by the way.

>From my side I was hoping on doing one larger feature jump for 32-bit
ARM by moving over to IOMMU_DMA=y together with ->of_xlate()and fwspec
at the same time. Doing minor increments of the legacy code that is
still using special mapping code instead of OMMU_DMA=y in case of
32-bit ARM just feels like a lot of potential breakage and little gain
to me.

What's the plan for supporting IOMMU_DMA=y on 32-bit ARM? Anything I
can do to help? Or do you prefer minor increments on 32-bit ARM over
larger feature jumps?

Let me know what you think. My plan is to revisit this topic early next week.

Cheers,
