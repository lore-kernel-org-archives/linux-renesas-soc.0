Agreed, let's just fail the probe() if DMA_BIT_MASK(64) fails, and
have swiotlb work around machines that for some reason need bounce
buffers.

If we do this, we should probably have another look at the respective
NETIF_F_HIGHDMA support in the network stack, which does the same thing
and mixes up highmem on 32-bit architectures with the DMA address limit.
(side note: there are actually cases in which you have a 31-bit DMA
mask but 3 GB of lowmem using CONFIG_VMSPLIT_1G, so BLK_BOUNCE_HIGH
and !NETIF_F_HIGHDMA are both missing the limit, causing data corruption
without swiotlb).

Before we rely too much on swiotlb, we may also need to consider which
architectures today rely on bouncing in blk and network.

I see that we have CONFIG_ARCH_PHYS_ADDR_T_64BIT on a couple of
32-bit architectures without swiotlb (arc, arm, some mips32), and
there are several 64-bit architectures that do not have swiotlb
(alpha, parisc, s390, sparc). I believe that alpha, s390 and sparc
always use some form of IOMMU, but the other four apparently don't,
so we would need to add swiotlb support there to remove all the
bounce buffering in network and block layers.
