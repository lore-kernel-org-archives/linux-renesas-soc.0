Hello,

Reviving this old thread.

I gave this a try, and unfortunately it won't work.

pm_genpd_prepare() resumes devices without increasing the usage count, which 
leads to the device always being active in pm_runtime_force_suspend(). The 
usage count will be 1 if the device was suspended prior to entering system 
suspend (due to the pm_runtime_get_noresume() call in device_prepare()) or 
higher than 1 if the device was active.

However, pm_genpd_prepare() will not resume the device if suspend_power_off is 
set. In that case the device will be suspended with a usage count of 1 in 
pm_runtime_force_suspend() or active with a usage count higher than 1.

We thus can't detect at resume time whether we have force-suspended the device 
using the usage count.

Unless someone has another clever idea I'll keep the power.is_force_suspended 
flag and protect it with power.lock.

Looking forward to seeing patches :-)
