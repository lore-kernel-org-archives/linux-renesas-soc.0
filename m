OK. IMO it's cpu peripheral which has no mmio similar to architected
timers that are accessed via system registers. So representing them with
reg = mpidr sounds not correct. If DT maintainers are OK with such
representation, it should be fine but better to document it.

Agreed as I mentioned above.
