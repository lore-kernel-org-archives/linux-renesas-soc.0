That is how the build-in connection descriptions are handled, but in
this case you want to describe them in your bindings, and to do that you
should use remote-endpoints, ie. OF graph bindings: bindings/graph.txt

You don't necessarily need to propose any changes to the device
connection framework at this point, but you do need to use graph for
describing that connection. Once we add device graph handling to the
device connection framework, it is no problem to update this driver.

Of course, if you have time and interest in preparing a proposal for
graph handling to the device connection framework, I would appreciate
it.
