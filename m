I always found it strange that you have both "ethtool wol" and and a
"wakeup" file
in sysfs (does "ethtool wol" predate the wakeup file in sysfs?)

I believe originally WoL supported MagicPacket only (many systems still
support only that), so originally it was boolean.

OK.

Next question: where to document device-specific sysfs files for regulators?
