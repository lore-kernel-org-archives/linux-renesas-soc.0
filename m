It's the least evil solution.

Right, but that's something we _had_ solved before multiplatform came
along.

If you think that Versatile + Realview + Integrator + Vexpress should
be lumped into one kernel image for !MMU and XIP_KERNEL then you're
wrong - from what I remember, their RAM and flash locations are quite
different which rules it out.

The biggest thing that matters for !MMU and XIP_KERNEL is the location
of flash and RAM.  If those are not compatible, !MMU and XIP_KERNEL
has no chance of working.

Right, but that's debug, not core kernel configuration.
