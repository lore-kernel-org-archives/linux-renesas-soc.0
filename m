Actually, the first version I posted treated the return codes from
pm_runtime_get_sync() according to your suggestion above.

However, Kishon pointed out that it didn't work. That's because, there
are phy provider drivers that enables runtime PM *after* calling
phy_create(). And in those cases, that is because they want to treat
runtime PM themselves.

I think that's probably something we should look into to change, but I
find it being a separate issue, that I didn't want to investigate as
part of this series.

See more about the thread here:

Right, this makes sense. Let me clarify this in the changelog.

Kind regards
