Document "pinmux" property as part of generic pin controller
documentation.
Fix 2 minor typos in documentation while at there.

Hi Linus and linux-gpio community.

During development of Renesas RZ/A1 pin controller I've been suggested to add
description of "pinmux" property to generic pin controller documentation.
Currently several pin controller drivers are using this property in place of
the already documented "pin"/"group" and "function" ones: stm32, mt65xx, mt8173
and in-review r7s72100, not sure about at91-sama5d2)

Sending this one as RFC to collect feedback. If the change is not rejected is it
worth adding to pin controller core helper functions to parse the newly
documented property, as this commit
<https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9411231/>
did for "pinctrl-pin-array" one?

All drivers using "pinmux" exhibit the same behavior which is fine as long as
"pinmux" only accepts a list of u32 parameters.

	...
	pins = of_find_property(node, "pinmux", NULL);
	...
	npins = pins->length / sizeof(u32);
	...
	of_property_read_u32_index(node, "pinmux",
				   i, &pinfunc);
	...

Thanks
