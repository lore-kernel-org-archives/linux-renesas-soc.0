Perhaps out-of-band IRQ is a too vague term. :-) Anyway, let me
elaborate a bit more.

Apologize for being so persistent, but I really want to get to bottom with this.

According to the statement above, it seems like IRQs (including GPIOs)
is controllable from a separate "power area" (or module clock). In
many ARM SoCs that "power area" is a separate piece of external logic,
sometimes it may even consist a small co-processor. I guess you
already know that, but wanted to point it out for clarity.

For that reason, some serial drivers re-routs its serial rx pin to a
GPIO IRQ to deal with wakeup, instead of keeping the serial device
always powered. This enables the GPIO IRQ to be managed by the
external logic, thus allowing the serial device and the PM domain it
is attached to, to be powered off. Especially during system suspend,
that may avoid wasting lots of power.

Another example, where I think a more fine grained method is preferred
over using GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP, is when an SD card controller has
an card detect pin hooked up to a GPIO. Thus the device_may_wakeup()
would return true for the SD card controller's struct device, but that
does not mean that the device needs to stay powered during system
suspend.
