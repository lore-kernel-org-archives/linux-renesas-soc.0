I am sorry I forgot to copy the explanation across from the first version o=
f the patch:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10111831/

"the reason for replacing the example with one of a different SoC is that
the new example refers to recent code from a real use case. I hope that's o=
k."

Basically the r8a7743 will be the first platform with full upstream support=
, and I believe it is better to have up-to-date examples proven to work in =
the documentation.

Shall I send a new version for this?


Thanks,
Fab
