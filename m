It's a much rarer problem for the IOMMU case though, because it only
impacts devices that are restricted to addressing of less than 32-bits.

If you have an IOMMU enabled, the dma-mapping interface does not care
if the device can do wider than 32 bit addressing, as it will never
hand out IOVAs above 0xffffffff.

That problem should only impact virtual machines which have a guest
bus address space covering more than 42 bits of physical RAM, whereas
the problem we have with swiotlb is for the dma-mapping interface.

With swiotlb enabled, it only needs to fail if the mask does not contain
the swiotlb bounce buffer area, either because the start of RAM is outside
of the mask, or the bounce area has been allocated at the end of ZONE_DMA
and the mask is smaller than ZONE_DMA.
