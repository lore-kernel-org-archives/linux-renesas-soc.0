I see no problem with the patch itself but as you point out bellow there 
are other patches which makes of the change I assume? The change to 
vin_to_source() on it's own would not add much value as vin_to_source() 
is currently only used in the none-mc parts of the driver where the 
change bellow would never be used.

My dream would be to one day drop the none-mc mode of this driver, or 
split it out to a rcar-vin-legacy module or something ;-)

I'm no expert on when the crop/selection rectangles shall be reset and 
have wrestled with this in the past for this driver. I have partial 
rework of how formats especially crop/selection works planed. My goal of 
that is to try and make it simpler and more straight forward taking 
ideas from the vivid driver. There are some limitations in my 
implementation of this in the current driver which prevents me from 
adding sequential formats and enable the UDS scaler.

This is a problem I ponder from time to time, happy to hear I'm not the 
only one :-) My view is that events are somewhat not functional in the 
media controller world and should be fixed at the framework level, maybe 
by moving them from the vdev to the mdev :-)

I think it's great that you worked on the problem but I'm a bit 
concerned with addressing this on a driver basis. Maybe this is 
something to bring up at the next v4l2 summit? I might be wrong here and 
there already is a consensus to address this as you describe in each
driver. Do you have any insights on the topic?

Interesting, maybe I'm missing something but would it not be a better 
solution to add support for V4L2_FIELD_ALTERNATE to rcar-vin instead of 
abusing V4L2_FIELD_NONE?

I'm happy to see work being done on the driver and would of course like 
to help you get all changes upstream so that all your use-cases would 
work out-of-the-box.
