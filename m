So, for *node* names, '/' clearly has to be banned, because that's the
path separator, so allowing it in components would make paths
ambiguous.

I realized after I wrote that that it's not quite so clear cut for
property names.  There are some reasons not to allow it still, but
they're not quite as irrefutable as for node names:

 * Keeping the same allowed character set for each, for consistency

 * Avoiding the same ambiguity if people use the notation
   /path/to/node/property.  That's not really correct anyway, but you
   see it sometimes

 * Avoiding problems for clients which translate property into names
   in the filesystem (Linux does this in order to present
   /proc/device-tree and similar for debugging).

Note that what we've historically allowed for fdts is a bit different
=66rom what IEE1275 officially allowed - part of that is because a bunch
of OF implementations in the wild long used characters that weren't
permitted by the spec (we're looking at you, Apple).  '/' has always
been prohibited in every variant, though.

For properties, 1275 allowed any printable character except uppercase
letters, '/', '\', ':', '[', ']' and '@'.

For nodes, 1275 allowed only characters in [a-zA-Z0-9,._+-].  That's
not counting the unit-address part (from the @ sign onwards), which is
bus dependent.  I'm not exactly sure if there were general limits on
what was bus definitions could allow in that part, but in practice
things outside [0-9a-f] are rare, and I know of no bus which allowed
things outside [0-9a-z,].

In dtc, we allow [a-zA-Z0-9,._+*#?@-] for both nodes and properties,
and it doesn't look like that's changed since 2007.

We possibly could, although I don't much like the idea.  Note that
merely allowing it wouldn't make it magically work.  Tools which apply
overlays (libfdt & the kernel at minimum) would still need code
changes to explicitly understand this type of fixup.
