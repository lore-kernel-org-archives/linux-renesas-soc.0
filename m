Thanks for your series!

If you fix the subject of patch 30:
Acked-by: Geert Uytterhoeven <geert+renesas@glider.be>

I guess this is against v4.5-rc7? It doesn't apply against
renesas-devel-20160308-v4.5-rc7.
Unfortunately you'll have to rebase against Simon's tree, and add scif2
on r8a7790, and i2c[6-8] on r8a7793.

Hint for the other reviewers: use the --color-words option of git diff/show.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

                        Geert
