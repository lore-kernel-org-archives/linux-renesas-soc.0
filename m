   Not only that, the TMUs having the input capture also can use external clock
as they have the TCLK<n> signal.

   They don't, most probably.

   Perhaps we should describe a "renesas,tmu-ext-clk" for the TMUs having an external
clock? Will this make you happy?

   ... and having external clock.

   At this point, the driver only uses internal clock... we can document the external
clock for the compatible value I've just suggested... Will that make you happy? :-)
