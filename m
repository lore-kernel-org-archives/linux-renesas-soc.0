How about a range of -4% to +2% ?

So I looked at that.

However...

Technically, to do it right, to calculate the ACTUAL I2C baud rate, you=20
have to take into effect the load resistance and capacitance of the=20
lines in order to factor in the rise and fall times correctly. Of course=20
that varies board to board. And then, 100kHz (standard-mode) and 400kHz=20
(fast-mode) have different minimum HIGH/LOW times and duty cycle=20
restrictions, so that has to be taken into account when coming up with a fo=
rmula.

   --or--

Just live with the fact that the speed might be off by 4%.


   (I decided on option #2)
