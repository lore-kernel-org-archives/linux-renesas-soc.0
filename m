Yes, I am able to access the gitweb instance too :)

Understood. Thanks. Since I've gone off-topic quite a bit already, may I
have your feedback on below questions sitting in the back of my mind for
some time:

 - There seem to be quite a number of non-mainlined rcar-vin patches
   sitting on top of v4.14.75-ltsi and part of rcar-3.9.x release. With
   some false positives, around 35-40 such commits can be identified as
   shown in [1]. Based on my checks, only a small subset of them are
   (actively) discussed in linux-media/linux-renesas-soc ML and for most
   of them I can't find any trace. I am just curious if there is any
   background force driving the upstreaming of those patches or the
   submissions/discussions happen rather by accident?

 - I am seeing two sets of rcar-vin tests [2-3] and I think there is a
   parent/fork relationship between them, but now they appear to be
   diverged. Which one would you recommend? What's the test coverage
   provided by these suites? Do you see room/chance for something like
   drivers/gpu/drm/selftests in rcar-vin in future (maybe using
   the upcoming kunit [4] approach?). BTW, we've been using the
   vsp-tests for quite some time and they've been extremely useful in
   pointing out regressions in our own patches. So, many thanks for
   sharing those too.
