Yes, and the underlying issue of the fb backlight notifier being tangled
up in everything else is also still there. But I think both are a bit too
big to be tackled in an -rc (even if -rc1 isn't even there yet).

I think we should try to get your patch in still for 4.9, and maybe we can
trick someone into at least untangling the backlight stuff from the fb
notifier at large.
