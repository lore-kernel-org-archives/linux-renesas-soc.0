Yes I think that's the best course of action.

The problem is that if any of the fixes has to be reverted we have
to revert the whole thing instead of just the problematic patch,
which, given that we are sending this to stable kernels may easily
turn out quite complicated.

So, I would add the new API along with the earliest broken driver
and mark it for stable.

In the same thread, add all other fixes (one per patch) without the
stable tag. When the first fix gets merged into the mainline (and
consequently goes to stable) we can send the stable backports for the
remainder of fixes.

How does that sound ?

We shall try, please let me know if you are able to respin asap,
we already have a bunch of fixes queued.

Thanks for putting it together,
