I thought there is difficult to find if a device has multiple ports or endp=
oints.
So, I'd like to use port and endpoint number for finding a device.

I think using device_connection_find_match() for finding the graph becomes =
complicated.
The current arguments of the function is the below:

void *device_connection_find_match(struct device *dev, const char *con_id,
			       void *data,
			       void *(*match)(struct device_connection *con,
					      int ep, void *data))

If finding the graph, the following arguments will be not used.
 - con_id
 - *con and ep of "match" arguments.

This is because these arguments are for the build-in connections.
So, should I modify the arguments of the function for finding both
the graph and built-in connections somehow?
