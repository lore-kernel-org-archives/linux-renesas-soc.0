Subject: [PATCHv3 0/6] pinctrl: sh-pfc: Fixups for bias handling and preparation for none GPIO pins

Hi,

This series fixes two issues I encounter for bias handling in the PFC
while preparing my drive strength patch set.

I also attached a new patch 6/6 that adds the macro
SH_PFC_PIN_NAMED_CFG() and was previously part of the series 'pinctrl:
sh-pfc: r8a7795: Support none GPIO pins with configurable
drive-strength'.

The reason I moved this patch to this series are both 6/6 and the new
bias helper function introduced in 2/6 are dependencies for other PFC
patch series I wish to send out. So to simplify the dependencies between
series this looked like the best option, if not please let me know.

Changes since v2
- Change return type and arguments to the bias information lookup function 
  after feedback from Laurent.
- Changed bias info structure data types to avoid unneeded padding after 
  feedback from Laurent.
- Sort variable declaration in descending line length order.
- Add Reviewed-by tag from Laurent.

Changes since v1
- Moved bias helper function from pfc-r8a7795.c to the sh-pfc core.
- Convert r8a7778 to use the new bias helper function.
- Fixed up spelling and attached Ack-tags.
- Attached a patch to add SH_PFC_PIN_NAMED_CFG() to simplify
  dependencies for other series.
