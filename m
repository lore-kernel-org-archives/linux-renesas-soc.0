I didn't see before this document. (I had downloaded what Chris
referred to, which has less than 1200 pages).

The figure you pointed to is really nice and explains it, thank you.

So, BiDi in this hardware is just helper to enable Input
simultaneously when you enable output.

This makes me wonder what prevents you to do this in two steps in software?
So, basically in terms of pin control framework you define this pin
configuration as

1. PIN_CONFIG_INPUT_ENABLE:
2. PIN_CONFIG_OUTPUT:

(or wise versa)

I guess Linus is better than me could answer to this.

So, when you configuring pinmux to use group of pins to be i2c, what
does prevent you to apply those settings implicitly?
