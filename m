Correct. But that's not the issue.

The above is not the log, but the diff between the log before and after the bad
commit. So lines prefixed with "-" are no longer printed.
Before, CPU4-7 were tested for hotplug in group 1.
After, only CPU4 is tested for hotplug in group 1.

arm64 defconfig + CONFIG_ARM_PSCI_CHECKER=y should do.

Thanks!
