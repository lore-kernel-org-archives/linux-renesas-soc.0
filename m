NVMe shouldn't have to call blk_queue_bounce_limit - 
blk_queue_bounce_limit is to set the DMA addressing limit of the device.
NVMe devices must support unlimited 64-bit addressing and thus calling
blk_queue_bounce_limit from NVMe does not make sense.

That being said currently the default for a queue without a call
to blk_queue_make_request which does the wrong thing on highmem
setups, so we should fix it.  In fact BLK_BOUNCE_HIGH as-is doesn't
really make much sense these days as no driver should ever dereference
pages passed to it directly.

NVMe should never bounce, the fact that it currently possibly does
for highmem pages is a bug.

That's not ironic but the whole point of the macro (horrible name and
the fact that it should be a dma_ops setting aside).

Or even better remove the call to dma_set_mask_and_coherent with
DMA_BIT_MASK(32).  NVMe is designed around having proper 64-bit DMA
addressing, there is not point in trying to pretent it works without that

We need to kill off BLK_BOUNCE_HIGH, it just doesn't make sense to
mix the highmem aspect with the addressing limits.  In fact the whole
block bouncing scheme doesn't make much sense at all these days, we
should rely on swiotlb instead.

For block I/O that is never the case.
