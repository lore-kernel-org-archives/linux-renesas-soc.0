Thanks for the explanation, now I understand why it only happens on 
mmc0.

I played around a bit with what you suggested above and here are my 
observations:

1. Removing "sd-uhs-sdr104;" from my Koelsch DTS do indeed make the 
   warning go away.

2. sh_mobile_sdhi_hw_reset() is called each time I insert the card. The 
   warning is as previously stated triggered on the first insertion.

3. If I turn the sh_mobile_sdhi_hw_reset() into a noop function (just 
   return without doing anything) the warning gets printed each time the 
   card is inserted.

As it turns out sh_mobile_sdhi_hw_reset() have something to do with the 
warnings and was a good point for me to start digging at.

The warning originates from mmc_send_tuning() inside a loop in
tmio_mmc_execute_tuning():

    /* Issue CMD19 twice for each tap */
    for (i = 0; i < 2 * host->tap_num; i++) {
            if (host->prepare_tuning)
                    host->prepare_tuning(host, i % host->tap_num);

            ret = mmc_send_tuning(mmc, opcode, NULL);
            if (ret && ret != -EILSEQ)
                    goto out;
            if (ret == 0)
                    set_bit(i, host->taps);

            mdelay(1);
    }

The warning is printed for me on loop iteration 7 and 15, which if I 
understand things correctly is for the same tap (7)?

If I track mmc_send_tuning() it looks like t starts a command 
(__mmc_start_req()) and then waits for it to finish 
(mmc_wait_for_req_done()) and it is in between these calls our warning 
is printed.

If i dig a bit deeper starting at __mmc_start_req() I end up where I 
think the command which generates the warning is issued to the hardware 
in tmio_mmc_start_command(). Simplified call graph:

tmio_mmc_execute_tuning()
  mmc_send_tuning()
    mmc_wait_for_req()
      __mmc_start_req()
        ...
          ...
            tmio_mmc_start_command()
      mmc_wait_for_req_done()

At the very end of  tmio_mmc_start_command() the command is fired to the 
hardware and it's right after that the warning is printed. With a bit 
creative msleep() and pr_info() I think I can confirm this like this:

   /* Fire off the command */
   sd_ctrl_write32_as_16_and_16(host, CTL_ARG_REG, cmd->arg);
   pr_info("%s 1\n", __func__);
   msleep(1000);
   pr_info("%s 2\n", __func__);
   sd_ctrl_write16(host, CTL_SD_CMD, c);
   pr_info("%s 3\n", __func__);
   msleep(1000);
   pr_info("%s 4\n", __func__);

Which gives the output for the loop itteration 7 and 15 in 
tmio_mmc_execute_tuning():

[  136.046594] tmio_mmc_start_command 1
[  137.116454] tmio_mmc_start_command 2
[  137.122399] tmio_mmc_start_command 3
[  137.122461] ipmmu-vmsa e6740000.mmu: Unhandled fault: status 0x00002101 iova 0x40002000
[  138.156454] tmio_mmc_start_command 4

Arriving at this I feel my knowledge reached its limit and would like to 
hear what you think about my findings and possible fix? First of is this 
a possible place for the warning to originate?

Why do it only happen for tap 7? Tap 0-6 are fine. I did double check 
the TAPNUM from sh_mobile_sdhi_init_tuning() return 8. And that the 
TAPNUMS used in sh_mobile_sdhi_prepare_tuning() is in the range 0-7.  
This should as far as I understand the docs be correct?

I do however have a patch that makes the warnings go away :-) But I 
would like to hear what you have to say about the above and about the 
patch itself before I send it of as a real patch, my knowledge about 
this driver is rudimentary at best and the patch is just a product of 
what I learnt while investigating this issue.

Let me know if you think this is a suitable fix and I will resend it as 
a proper patch. Whit this applied the warnings are no more and I can 
properly interact with the card, I do however only have a SDR50 card to 
try with.
