This is an exception and it would be better to call
device_wakeup_disable() directly here.

In general, calling device_set_wakeup_enable() during system suspend (to
"enable" device wakeup) and then during system resume (to "disable" it) may
be problematic.

First, if device_wakeup_enable() is run during system suspend, it will
create a wakeup source object, which then, quite obviously, can only cover
the time after its creation, so there is a window (between the start of the
system suspend transition and the creation of the wakeup source) during
which wakeup events may be missed.

That is not only relevant for devices supporting runtime PM, because input
device drivers, say, may choose to report system wakeup events every time
they see input (eg. from their interrupt handlers or similar) and wakeup
sources used for that should be present before system suspend begins.

Also, if the wakeup source is not present already, this effectively overrides
the choice made by user space which didn't set the device's "wakeup" attribute
in sysfs to "enabled", so it should not wake up the system.

Second, if device_wakeup_disable() is run during system resume, it effectively
destroys information that can be used to figure out why the system woke up
and, again, it may cause the choice made by user space to be effectively
overridden.

However, if the device is dead, calling device_wakeup_disable() on it is fine
at any time (as dead devices do not wake up the system as a rule).

Not really in this particular case.  Clearing the wakeup enable bit for the
device plays the role of "don't bother any more" here.
