There's probably also DT changes that enable new features folks would
want/need? Or maybe carrying for some number of LTS releases is
enough.

In an ideal world, we would have some tool:

dt-diff-to-overlay old.dts new.dts > my-fixup-overlay.dts

And then in the kernel have infrastructure such you just declare match
tables with overlays to apply:

struct of_device_id dt_match[] = {
  {
    .compatible = "vendor,board",
  },
  {},
};
DT_FIXUP(dt_match, my-fixup-overlay.dtbo);

But maybe I'm dreaming...

Yes, it's currently a 4 or so step process that we plan to make a single call.
