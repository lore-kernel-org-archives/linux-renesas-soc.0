Correct!

Agree!

Correct.

Correct.

Yes.

The principle is that the driver needs to runtime resume its device,
if not already, during system suspend, as to be able to configure the
in-band interrupt, then instruct the upper layers that the device
needs to stay in its current power state.

Perfect!

Yeah, let me try to clarify that in the doc.
