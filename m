I am interested in adding IPMMU-VMSA support to Xen hypervisor.

I did some preparations for making IPMMU-VMSA to feel comfortable [1] 
inside Xen
followed by direct porting Linux IPMMU-VMSA driver and ARM LPAE 
page-table allocator [2] to it.

I decided to base on the "BSP" driver [3] because it had more complete 
support than the "mainline" one [4].

During review I got a feedback that "BSP" driver wasn't the best choice 
to be ported.
Xen ARM maintainers worry about "BSP" driver which haven't had a 
thorough review by the Linux community and as the result might have bugs 
which will never be fixed, etc.

So, for the IPMMU-VMSA support to be accepted by Xen community I should 
either write our own driver based on BSP/mainline/whatever which 
contains only relevant to Xen things or
direct port from "mainline" driver. As the second option relies on the 
required support [5] which isn't in mainline yet, it is not clear when 
this support gets merged and how it will be modified/reworked before,
we preliminarily decided to follow the first option. But, I would like 
to consider second option again. Despite the complexity of second 
option, it has one significant benefit.

I see that Linux driver is being developed quite actively and looking 
over all related patch series I got a feeling that required support was 
about to reach upstream.

Could you, please, clarify some questions which, I hope, help us to make 
a decision:
1. Do you have approximate time-frame for getting this support in?
2. Are fundamental/significant changes planned for this support?

Also, may I ask for a link to github branch which contains current (and 
likely r8a7795 and 32-bit ARM update) patch series?

Thank you in advance!

And sorry for the most likely incorrect format of this email.
