I'm so sorry, but this is mistake.
The renesas_usbhs doesn't use the phy_rcar_gen3_usb2 driver.

They are also mistake.

Yes, the phy_rcar_gen3_usb2 uses runtime PM.

I also think that now.
I don't find why for now, but the usage_count of a phy device was not 1 jus=
t before suspend.
(This "a phy device" means the child of ee0a0200.usb-phy device.)

It's a phy device:
