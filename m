After some investigations, it turns out some register settings
performed during pin_reset() are invalid and hang the system BUT only
when performed on Port_9.

Specifically, setting PMC and PIPC registers to 0 (default initial state)
on Port_9, hangs the system.

There is no mention (none that I've found) in the processor manual of
specific procedures to be performed when resetting that port to its
initial state, so I guess this may either be an indication of
something else going wrong (like writing to some invalid memory
address) or it's an HW issue not yet documented.

Timur's patch does trigger a "reset" on all Ports during gpiochip
registration , while before that patch made into -next branch, reset
was only triggered when actually requesting a gpio or when performing
muxing on a pin.

Apparently, we never multiplexed any pin on Port_9 nor tested gpio
functionalities on that port before.

This:

@@ -487,8 +491,10 @@ static void rza1_pin_reset(struct rza1_port *port, unsigned int pin)
        rza1_set_bit(port, RZA1_PBDC_REG, pin, 0);

        rza1_set_bit(port, RZA1_PM_REG, pin, 1);
-       rza1_set_bit(port, RZA1_PMC_REG, pin, 0);
-       rza1_set_bit(port, RZA1_PIPC_REG, pin, 0);
+       if (port->id != 9) {
+               rza1_set_bit(port, RZA1_PMC_REG, pin, 0);
+               rza1_set_bit(port, RZA1_PIPC_REG, pin, 0);
+       }
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&port->lock, irqflags);
 }

Fixes the issue, but I'm not that satisfied with this as I would like
to know if the same issue happens on other processors of the RZ/A1 family
other than RZ/A1H before proposing this as a proper fix.

Chris, do you have RZ/A1* devices where to test this?

Thanks
