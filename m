I realize that I did read *pm_genpd_prepare()* as *device_prepare()*,
which represents the behaviour of the PM core during the prepare phase
(drivers/base/power/main.c). In such cases my earlier reply would make
more sense, I believe.

Apologize for giving you the wrong input by not reading your response
in more detail!

Yes.

Although, genpd is not behaving as it should here. It must *not*
resume all devices, just because the domain is powered.

The resume callback of genpd decides what will happen, as its a PM
domain and it sits on top of the hierarchy of a devices PM callbacks.

As you have realized, there are issues in genpd regarding the system
PM code, there have even been reports about it.

For example, genpd prevents subsystem/drivers from manage their
devices during system PM - when it start the system PM phase with the
domain in powered off state.

That's not an okay behaviour, as it can't know whether a device needs
to be used to serve a request after that point, causing the device to
be runtime resumed. As genpd prevents it to be suspended via system
PM, it will stay resumed during the system PM suspend phase, at least
that is my understanding and it seems like bad idea.

In general, the system PM code in genpd needs to be modernized. It
somewhat duplicating some code from the PM core and I think the code
can be greatly simplified.

I have started to work on this quite recently, once the first steps
are done I will consider optimizations, such as not runtime resuming
devices unnecessarily.

Okay, great! :-)

Again, sorry for the giving the wrong input earlier!

Future wise, I will keep you on cc on any related genpd patches.

Kind regards
