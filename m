Subject: [PATCH v3 0/5] mmc: tmio: make CTL_STATUS handling consistent
Date: Wed, 27 Apr 2016 18:51:22 +0200

It took me a little to discover that CTL_STATUS has a different handling than
the other registers. CTL_STATUS and CTL_STATUS2, both u16, are merged into a
virtual u32. However, CTL_STATUS2 was also directly accessed.

Clean this up, make this consistent, and document this. Making the driver less
complex and easier to work with.

Tested on Renesas R-Car Gen2 and Gen3.

Changes since V2:

* rebased to mmc/next. Sorry Ulf, my branch had an older version of your next
  included and I missed the update :(


Wolfram Sang (5):
  mmc: tmio: give read32/write32 functions more descriptive names
  mmc: tmio: use BIT() within defines
  mmc: tmio: use CTL_STATUS consistently
  mmc: tmio/sdhi: distinguish between SCLKDIVEN and ILL_FUNC
  mmc: tmio: document CTL_STATUS handling
