Unfortunately, this can't work with the current overlay format.  We
have a specific syntax to allow the target of an overlay fragment to
specified as a path, but phandle references by path won't work.

The problem is that the encoding of the fixups node has the fixup
target as a property name, and as the error says '/' is an illegal
character in property names - for a bunch of good reasons, so we can't
just go and remove that restriction.

So to allow this we'd need to come up with a different encoding for
path-targeted fixups and add support for it in the various pieces of
the chain.

One way to do that would be to entirely rework the overlay format to
something more sensible, which would have a number of other benefits.
