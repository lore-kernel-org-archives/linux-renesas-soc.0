Ok I will update the log then.

If we want to send it to stable kernels we have to select which versions
we are covering. I think the only options for a Fixes: tag are either
the initial S2R support commit for the platforms this driver runs on
or the initial driver commit that harks back to v3.16 AFAICS.

I will queue it next week so there is some time to think about it.
