Hi Geert,

After rebasing this series on top of Simon's latest devel branch, I'm 
experiencing hard system freezes when using the VSP.

What makes the problem curious is that PM runtime works fine when the VSP 
instances are probed, the A3VP power domain is turned on and off correctly for 
each instance. However, after booting the system, if I try to RPM resume the 
device, the system hangs.

I've traced this (using printk debugging) down to the SYSCISCR write in 
rcar_sysc_power(). The value written is 0x00000200, which corresponds to the 
A3VP power domain, and the resume request completion wait loop doesn't time 
out.

Does this ring any bell ? Do you have a more recent version of this patch 
series that I could try ?
