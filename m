The feedback I received is something like this:

* The tap values calculated during retuning depend on the temperature of
  the SoC and card.
* So after resume the values may be invalid.
* It may be possible to re-use the TAP values and re-tune if a transfer
  fails but the people I spoke with were unsure of the merit of that
  approach

Personally my feeling is that we should initiate a retune on resume for
now as that seems to be the safest option.
