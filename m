While I'm not the maintainer for this (and I'm not clear that the
linux-sh list even should have been cc'd; it seems to be shmobile arm
soc stuff rather than sh arch) I think this is a bad change. If the
driver is completely unused, it should just be removed, but if there
are remaining users that are still using legacy platform device
bindings, they should gradually be transitioned to device tree, and
having the device tree support still present makes it easier to do
that.

Removing the *bindings* is even worse, as these are a permanent
interface between hardware/firmware and software.
