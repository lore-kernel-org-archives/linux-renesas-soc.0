Subject: [PATCH v5 00/12] ARM/arm64: dts: rcar: Add SYSC PM domains

	Hi Simon, Magnus,

This patch series adds the R-Car System Controller to the DTS files for
the various Renesas R-Car SoCs, and hooks up devices to their respective
PM domains.

This is a dependency for the enablement of DU and VSP on R-Car H3, as
on this SoC the VSPs are located in a PM Domain.

This series contains 2 parts:
  1. Patches 1-6 add device node for the System Controllers, and hook
     up CPU cores and L2 caches/SCUs to their respective PM Domains,
  2. Patches 7-12 hook up devices to the SYSC "always-on" PM Domain, for
     a more consistent device-power-area description in DT.

As "[PATCH v5 00/11] soc: renesas: Add R-Car SYSC PM Domain Support"
merged the two initialization phases again, the issues in v4 caused by
excessive deferred probing are gone, and both parts are now safe to
apply.

Changes compared to v4:
  - Add Acked-by,
  - Remove "power-domains" property again from the sysc nodes, as the
    System Controller theirselves are not part of the Clock Domains.

Changes compared to v3:
  - Add power-domains properties to the sysc nodes, to refer to the
    SoC's Clock Domains,
  - Extract using the SYSC "always-on" PM Domain on R-Car H3 into its
    own patch,
  - Add patches to use the SYSC "always-on" PM Domain on R-Car H1 and
    R-Car Gen2,
  - Update for recently added can0, can1, pciec0, and pciec1 device
    nodes on R-Car H3.

Changes compared to v2:
  - Move power area hierarchy from DT to C (cfr. DT bindings for Renesas
    CPG/MSSR), and switch to "#power-domain-cells = <1>",
  - Drop fallback compatibility strings, as the bindings are
    SoC-specific,
  - Add an "always-on" power area on R-Car H3.

Changes compared to v1:
  - Add R-Car H3 (r8a7795) support,
  - Use "renesas,<type>-sysc" instead of "renesas,sysc-<type>",
  - Add fallback compatibility strings for R-Car Gen2 and Gen3.

Dependencies:
  - renesas-devel-20160411-v4.6-rc3
  - clk-renesas-for-v4.7
  - "[PATCH v2 0/4] clk: renesas: R-Car SYSC PM Domain Preparation",
  - "[PATCH v5 0/7] PM / Domains: Add DT bindings for the R-Car System
    Controller",
  - "[PATCH v5 00/11] soc: renesas: Add R-Car SYSC PM Domain Support".
Note that these are hard dependencies: adding SYSC PM Domains to DTS
files without driver support will cause breakage!

For your convenience, I've pushed this, incl. all dependencies, to the
topic/rcar-sysc-pd-v5 branch of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/geert/renesas-drivers.git.
Integration with renesas-drivers-2016-04-12-v4.6-rc3 is available in the
topic/gen3-latest branch.

This has been tested on r8a7779/marzen, r8a7790/lager, r8a7791/koelsch,
r8a7794/alt, and r8a7795/salvator-x.

Thanks for applying!
