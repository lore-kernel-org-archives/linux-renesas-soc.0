A few trivial merge conflicts are not a big deal, and you probably
don't need to notify in advance (we always check for them when we
prepare our pull requests).

However, conflicts like these are an indication that your development
or patch management flow isn't working quite right. You shouldn't step
on your own toes like this. Try to avoid it in the future by
coordinating better.
