I'm pretty certain you want to declare and initialize this variable
outside the loop.

I recommend adding parentheses around the bit matching when combined
with &&. I know it is not strictly needed and the compiler doesn't
care, but I find it easier to read, and there seems to be a consensus
(90 %) on that in the kernel tree.

I have 2 questions:

1* Repeated start happens between messages of a same transaction, and
you handle that case above. However in the case of 10-bit address
clients, there is also a repeated start happening during the address
phase of the transaction, if the first message is a read. Did you check
what the SCCB protocol expects in that case?

2* I'm not sure why you add the enforced stop at the end of one
iteration and the start at the beginning of the next iteration. It
would be more simple and efficient to do both at the beginning of the
next iteration. The only case where it would make a difference is if
both I2C_M_NOSTART and I2C_M_STOP are specified. In this case you
currently emit a stop condition but no start, which I don't think can
work at all.

What about something like that instead? Or I am missing something?
