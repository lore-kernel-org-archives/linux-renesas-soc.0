Of course the CPU is special: unlike many other devices, it must be running
when the kernel is reentered upon system resume.
It may be running using a different frequency setting, though.
However, following "opp-suspend", the system will always suspend with the
Z clock running at 1.5GHz, which is the default?
So Z is probably OK.

It's more interesting to check what happens when the little cores are
enabled as well (unfortunately that requires different firmware).
1. Does cpufreq handle them correctly when they are onlined again during
   system resume?
2. What happens if you offline all big cores, and enter system suspend
   running with little cores only?
   Perhaps that's prevented by the "opp-suspend" property as well?

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
