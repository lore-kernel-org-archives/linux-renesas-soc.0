That's essentially deliberate - it's not really related to this patch
at all.  The patch just re-uses the existing syntax for a "path
reference".  The whole thing is treated as a single token, hence, no
spaces.

It might be possible to change that, but it could introduce some
complications when the path reference syntax is used in other places.
So I'm disinclined to change it, unless there's a very strong reason
to.
