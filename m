There's no problem with the scope. The problem is with the
initialization. The way you did, did_stop gets reset to false with
every iteration, which isn't what you want.

I looked at how 10-bit addressing works again and in fact it is simply
impossible to not use repeated start when reading from a 10-bit address
slave. Only the first 2 bits of the 10-bit address are repeated in the
read part of the transaction. If there was a stop between the two parts
then there would be no way to know which 10-bit slave should send the
data.

Oops. Right, fixed, thanks.

I'll send a proper patch shortly.

You're welcome.
