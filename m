Hi Kieran,

I find this a bit unclear. I know how the hardware works and can thus
understand what you meant, but for someone with less knowledge of the
device (such as you or me in 6 months :-)) a clearer description would
be good. In particular explaining what happens at the edge of partitions
and why the window needs to be extended would be useful. This should
also document the .partition() operation and the arguments it takes, in
particular what the window refers to (if I remember it stores the
requested window for the output of the entity and returns the required
window for the input, but that should be written explicitly).

The second to last sentence is also quite confusing. "Each entity must
produce" reads like you're talking about the pixels produced by the
entity, while I think you mean the window computed by the .partition()
operation. Maybe something along the line of "Each entity reports the
window it requires at its input to generate the requested output, and
that window is propagated backward along the pipeline from entity to
entity." ?

Explaining the vsp1_partition_window offset field in more details would
be useful too. I initially commented about it below, but I think the
detailed description belongs here, where the comment should state that
the entities in the pipeline will generate incorrect pixels at the edges
due to the use of pixel duplication on the sink, and that those invalid
pixels must be clipped out. We thus start with a clipping offset equal
to zero, and propagate it forward through the pipeline asking each
entity how many invalid pixels it generates on the left side. You should
also explain that we only clip pixels out on the left side as partitions
are processed in the left to right order, so invalid pixels on the right
side will be overwritten by good pixels from the next partition. By the
way, does this hold true when rotating ?

I trust your English skills more than mine to create a coherent text
from all this :-)

"required partition" is also a bit unclear.

SRU is a bad example as it takes part in the partition size calculation.

Same here, "overlap" isn't defined anywhere. It may get clearer once the
documentation above is expanded though.

"Disposable pixels" is also unclear. Those pixels are not disposable,
they are required to compute the destination pixels correctly, but they
don't generate corresponding pixels in the destination for this
partition.

It's not clear how this differs from the backward pass :-)

Let's try to come up with a clear and detailed description, it will be
useful for the future. I know documentation is hard, but it's worth it.

I would either declare this as a bool, or an unsigned int scale_factor
equal to 1 or 2, in which case you could replace *= 2 and /= 2 with *=
scale_factor and /= scale_factor.

You could write this

		if (window->left != 0)
			window->offset++;

and drop vsp1_partition::sru that is used solely to store the offset.

Let's add an overall explanation.

	/*
	 * The SRU has a 3-tap pre-filter that generates the same number of
	 * pixels as it consumes. Edge output pixels are computed using edge
	 * pixel duplication at the input. This results in one incorrect output
	 * pixel on each side of the partition window after the pre-filter. To
	 * compensate for this, require one additional input pixel on each side
	 * before the pre-filter (thus before scaling).
	 *
	 * Additionally, the 2x up-scaler uses a bilinear post-filter and
	 * generates odd pixels from their two neighbours. The rightmost output
	 * pixel is thus computed using edge pixel duplication on the right side
	 * of the input (the leftmost output pixel is an even pixel, aligned
	 * with the leftmost input pixel and thus depends only on the
	 * corresponding pixel after the pre-filter). To compensate for this,
	 * require one additional input pixel on the right side when up-scaling.

This should be documented in the vsp1_partition structure, not here (or
not only here). Are all windows in the vsp1_partition structure related
to the sink pad of the corresponding entity ? If so, let's document is
globally (and I hope so, otherwise it would be quite confusing).

Does this also need to be conditioned to avoid an overlofw on the right
side ? Same question for the width++ inside the if (scale_up) above. I
wonder if it wouldn't be easier to remove all these conditions, turn the
window->left field into a signed int, and after the backward pass clamp
it to 0 (adjusting the offset field accordingly) and clamp the width to
the right side of the image. The logic in the entities would be simpler.

I'd say "simply pass on the output we computed in the backward pass.".

This means we can't support UDS after SRU. I recall you wanted to
experiment with this, should we already prepare by adding the offset
here ? Or would it require more intrusive changes that makes preparation
not worth it ? In the latter case I'd expand the comment to explain that
the offset is copied as-is because the driver ensures the SRU never
comes before the UDS.

Which source is this one, the input or the output ? :-)

Would this get simplified if we handled the left and right clamp in
vsp1_pipeline_propagate_partition() as proposed above ? The first
partition would end up being slightly smaller though, maybe it's not the
best idea. For the last partition I think it would be less of an issue.

"Step 3: Pull back dst_left (dst_pos0_pb) to the left to satisfy
alignment restrictions (the input of the bi-cubic filter must be aligned
to a multiple of the pre-filter multiplier)."

It would also be useful to add an explanation of the UDS operation,
similar to the one I wrote above for the SRU, that explains the
pre-filter and the bicubic filter (see figure 32.38).

This could also be written

	partition->start_phase = (4096 - remainder / mp) & 4095;

or

	partition->start_phase = (4096 - remainder / mp) % 4096;

Up to you.
