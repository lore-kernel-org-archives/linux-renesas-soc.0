It's always a good idea to put the warnings in the commit message:

The above indeed go away with your patch, but I don't know why ;-)

Both Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/pci.txt and ePAPR refer to
http://www.firmware.org/1275/bindings/pci/pci2_1.pdf
http://www.firmware.org/1275/practice/imap/imap0_9d.pdf
which no longer exist.
