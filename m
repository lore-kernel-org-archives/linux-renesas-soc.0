Subject: [PATCH 0/3] ARM: dts: r7s72100: add sdhi DT
Date: Thu, 22 Sep 2016 17:32:08 -0400
Message-Id: <20160922213211.7988-1-chris.brandt@renesas.com>

SUMMARY:
This series adds sdhi to the r7s72100 (RZ/A1) Device Tree.

DEPENDECIES:
This series is dependent on the tmio/sh_sdhi patches being
applied to add r7s72100 support.
  mmc: sh_mobile_sdhi: add ocr_mask option
  mmc: tmio-mmc: add support for 32bit data port
  mmc: sh_mobile_sdhi: Add r7s72100 support

MERGE CONFLICTS:
There are also patches being reviewed for adding mmc so depending on how
they get applied, there might be a line conflict.
To resolve the merge conflict, simply put the MMC nodes before
the SDHI nodes (just because that seems to be the order in other
Renesas SoCs DTs)
