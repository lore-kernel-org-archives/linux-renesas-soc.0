Subject: [RFC 0/4] mmc: tmio/sdhi: prevent regressions when setting clock
Date: Mon,  2 May 2016 22:25:38 +0200
Message-Id: <1462220742-4426-1-git-send-email-wsa@the-dreams.de>

Here is a small refactoring series for setting the clock for SDHI cores. This
is to prevent regression on platforms where this feature has not been tested.
One such regression is known on r8a7740 (patches 2+3). Patch 4 fixes an
oversight and patch 1 is a small cleanup.

RFC for now since I can't test these patches on my hardware currently. Will do
so on Wednesday, probably. Posting now since because Geert may already want to
test on r8a7740. Branch is here:

Thanks,

   Wolfram
