OK.

OK. Emma Mobile is special, as it doesn't share any drivers with the
other SoCs (NEC vs. Hitachi origin).

While RZ/A doesn't have a version registers (AFAIK), it shares several
drivers with the other SoCs (SH/R-Mobile, R-Car).
Hence I'd like to keep it, so we can match for it in these drivers when
needed. It has e.g. a different variant of the serial port (SCIF), more
closely to the one on SH2 rather than SH4.

Actually there are three (notice the extra "f" on R-Car Gen3 ;-)

Some SoCs have only CCCR, others have only PRR, some have both.
On some SoCs one of them can be accessed from the RealTime CPU
core (SH) only.
On some SoCs the register is not documented, but present.
If the PRR exists, it's a better choice, as it contains additional information
in the high order bits (representing the presence of each big (CA15/CA57),
little (CA7/CA53), and RT (CR7) CPU core). Currently we don't use that
information, though.

Grouping them in some other way means we would loose the family name,
which is exposed through soc_dev_attr->family.
The usefulness of family names is debatable though, as this is more an
issue of marketing business.

There's no simple relation between CCCR/PRR and other register blocks.
I prefer not to add these to DT, as that would add one more worm to the
backwards compatibility can.

Originally I had __maybe_unused, but it didn't seem to be needed.
Do you know which compiler needs it, so I can check?

Thanks for your comments!
