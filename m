Geert, I think we discussed this a bit already. I wonder if the above
is a correct statement for all devices in these PM domains, that has
wakeups?

Don't these SoCs make use of any external logic (out-of-band IRQ) to
deal with the wakeup IRQs?

For example, how is GPIO irqs dealt with in this regards?

If that is the case, you should really avoid using the big hammer
method of setting the GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP.
