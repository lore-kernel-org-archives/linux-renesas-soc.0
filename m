This check breaks the LCD backlight on r8a7740/armadillo.
Apparently both period and duty_cycle are zero during the first invocation.
Later, these are initialized from DT, cfr.

        pwms = <&tpu 2 33333 PWM_POLARITY_INVERTED>;

in arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7740-armadillo800eva.dts.

With added debug printing, the difference between failure and success is:

Sorry for not noticing last week, before it hit mainline.
