Hmm, but this makes it look like the problem is both arm64 and swiotlb
specific, when in reality it's not. Perhaps another hack you could try
would be to register a PCI bus notifier in the host bridge looking for
BUS_NOTIFY_BIND_DRIVER, then you could proxy the DMA ops for each child
device before the driver has probed, but adding a dma_set_mask callback
to limit the mask to what you need?

I agree that it would be better if dma_set_mask handled all of this
transparently, but it's all based on the underlying ops rather than the
bus type.
