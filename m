The main effect right now is that we're up from no warnings in the
default build to
hundreds of warnings, which is really annoying. Obviously there is
little gain in
fixing these but not the other warnings that were introduced, but I would either
want to fix them all, or disable the warning for one more release.

Rob, what do you think we should do here?
