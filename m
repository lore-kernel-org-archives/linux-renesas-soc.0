Subject: [PATCH v2 0/2] gpio: dwapb: Add support for 1 interrupt per port A GPIO

All details about the change is in patch 0001. patch 0002 fixes up other users
of 'struct dwapb_port_property'.

One point to mention is that I have made it possible for users to have
unconncted interrupts by specifying holes in the list of interrupts. This is
done by supporting the interrupts-extended DT prop.
However, I have no use for this and had to hack some test case for this.
Perhaps the driver should support 1 interrupt or all GPIOa as interrupts?
