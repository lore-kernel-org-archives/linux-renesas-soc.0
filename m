Why read the docs when the information obviously is there when you grep it?

I'm agreeing with you -- I've just seen it done wrong so many times.
Making it harder to make mistakes is always a good thing.

A drive can be auto-probed. We have partition tables on the disk that
self-describes the contents.

That doesn't exist on flashes, at least not usually. This is really
unfortunate, I wish we could change _that_ instead of argue here.

If you repartition your disk, you need to change the command line
arguments to the kernel too. It's definitely not an argument to
keeping it on the command line instead.

Also, you now have a dependencies between hardware description, probe
order and stable naming in the kernel, and the command line. With DT,
you have it all in one place, right next to the flash part. It doesn't
matter what name it gets probed at, and nobody needs to know the
mapping to get it right.
