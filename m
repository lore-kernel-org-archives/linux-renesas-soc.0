dai->codec is something we could get rid of since it is the same as
dai->component->codec. And for drivers were we know that it is a CODEC
driver you can use snd_soc_component_to_codec(dai->component). For those
drivers we know that this returns a valid pointer.

But there are a lot of users which all need to be updated. If you want to do
it go ahead. If you do the conversion this should be done by the use of
helper functions, so we can change the implementation if necessary.

This is a leftover of the old hierarchy where snd_soc_codec was not a
sub-struct of snd_soc_component.

I though about this when doing the refactoring of the ASoC core. But in the
end it does not make too much of a difference whether we have a flag field
or a CODEC pointer field. The former would have just caused more code churn
so I went with the later.

You wouldn't be able to simplify the code by this. You need to replace all
component->codec checks by component_is_codec(component). So the overall
code complexity stays the same.

The helper macros might still make sense to hide the actual implementation.

In my opinion the flags are just as much a hack as the pointer. In an ideal
setup the component does not need to know what type it is. The reason why we
need this in ASoC is because the framework has grown over time and we need
to support legacy code.
