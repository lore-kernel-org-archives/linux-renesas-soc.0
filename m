I'm very much with you. This is the very much reason I introduced
TMIO_MMC_MIN_RCAR2 in 3d376fb2ea907f ("mmc: tmio/sdhi: introduce flag
for RCar 2+ specific features") in the first place to be able to
"protect" old hardware from new features. It was not done before! This
is also the reason why we have commits like a21553c9e0c236 ("mmc:
tmio/sdhi: distinguish between SCLKDIVEN and ILL_FUNC") documenting a
difference between some old TMIO variant and our current SDHI. I spent
quite some time finding old TMIO information somewhere for that.

I didn't protect these callbacks before because I assumed they are only
called when SDR support is enabled via devicetree or platform data.
Which is not the case for all the old platforms. I sadly missed that
card_busy() is used when polling an SDIO card in case "broken-cd" is
used. That was a detail I overlooked, sorry. Given my work outlined
above I don't think one can deduce that I don't care about regressing
old hardware, though.

Not quite, it was introduced with 452e5eef6d311e ("mmc: tmio: Add UHS-I
mode support"). The commit you mentioned moved it from tmio*.c to
sdhi*.c

It can be argued that this tag could be added:

Fixes: 452e5eef6d311e ("mmc: tmio: Add UHS-I mode support")

I don't know how well it applies, though, because the code has been
modified a lot recently. But we can try.
