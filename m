Hi Jacopo and Laurent,

See, this makes me think that this will chew up even more system memory.

The thing about the RZ/A1 series is that it has internal RAM and we use
that along with XIP_KERNEL in order to build systems that do not require
external RAM.
So in the end, even if we can get sh-pfc to functionally work for RZ/A1,
it would be pretty sad if the device driver that uses the most system
memory is one that is really only used at boot time just to change some
pin configurations.

Personally, for the RZ/A series, I don't see the sh-pfc driver as a long
term solution. If people need something in the kernel today to general
testing, that's one thing. But if someone starts laying out a board
with any differences from the Renesas reference design, they might be
in for a rude awaking when trying to put together a BSP for their board.


If people really want this sh-pcf based driver upstreamed, I will try
to do some testing on my boards to make sure it at least does what it
is supposed to do. (wait for V3 patch set???)

Even so, I still plan on mocking up a new driver with the ideas from
this discussion (create a renesas-pfc.c) as a long term solution for
the RZ/A series. Whether that new driver architecture is worth upstreaming
or not, I guess we'll have to wait and see.

Cheers

Chris
