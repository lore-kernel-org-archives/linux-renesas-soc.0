Good, so there's no need for the DT property, and drivers/firmware/psci.c
should aways call do_cpu_idle() instead of PSCI SYSTEM_SUSPEND if any
other wake-up sources are configured?

That follows the principle of least surprise: it doesn't leave the user with
a system that won't wake up the way he configured it to wake up.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
