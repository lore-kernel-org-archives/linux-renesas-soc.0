Sorry about this, I thought sending to linux-gpio was enough.
We'll keep you in the loop now...

Well, more than names I have used the RZ_PIN_DESC macro as an extended 
version of the PINCTRL_PIN one, to set bank and pin fields of the 
rz_pin_desc structure that describes a pin.

The proposed DTS syntax identifies pins by their position (bank:pin) 
instead that by index, so I need to have those information available in 
pin description to identify them.

As we describe pins "by position", if I got your comment properly, we 
should be safe, as indexes are purely incremental values from [0-npins].

I know pinctrl-single (and other drivers such as imx one if I'm not 
wrong) uses pin indexes to calculate register offsets. This series 
doesn't but uses the [bank:pin] couple for that purpose instead.

Thanks
