Thanks for noting that.  I jumped to the (incorrect) conclusion that the
property should be one cell based on the code and the .dtsi.

There are about 4 more emails following this in the thread that discuss
what size cpu-release-addr should be.  Whatever the end result is (one
cell or two or based on some #XXX-calls value), it needs to be documented
consistently in the binding and in the DT spec (or preferably only in the
DT spec), and if it is a two cell property for this system then
smp-r9a06g032.c and r9a06g032.dtsi need to be adjusted to reflect that.
