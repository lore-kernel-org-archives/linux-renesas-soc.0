I am definitively not a Kbuild expert, but it would almost necessarily
require introduce some kind of new type in the Kconfig/Kbuild syntax
that does something like that:

- have a way to count the number of symbols that are selected and do a
"if ARCH_MULTI_V6_V7" (or an arbitrary expression) this most likely
should exist internally within Kconfig

- introduce a new type of Kconfig type which is a "count", and gets
assigned this value that we just counted, something that could look like
this:

count ARCH_MULTI_V6_V7_COUNT
	tracks ARCH_MULTI_V6_V7

All other typical Kconfig syntax thould then still apply and we could be
doing something like:

depends on ARCH_MULTI_V6_V7_COUNT=1 etc..

So yeah, I am no better than whoever gave you indications better ;)

Sure, that makes complete sense to me. FWIW, there is one particular
case that I am interested that you solved which is allowing
DEBUG_UNCOMPRESS to be set in our downstream kernel because we typically
only enable BRCMSTB and nothing else.
