Just a guess, but if the inbound translation windows in the host
bridge are wider than 32-bit, the reason for setting up a single
32-bit window is probably because that is what the parent bus supports.

It's likely that a few others also do high DMA, but a lot of arm64
chips are actually derived from earlier 32-bit chips and don't
even support any RAM above 4GB, as well as having a lot of 32-bit
DMA masters.

The "dma_addr" here is expressed in terms of #address-cells of the
bus it is in, and that is "3" in case of PCI, where the first 32-bit
word is a bit pattern containing various things, and the other two
cells are a 64-bit address. I think this is correct, but we may
need to add some special handling for parsing PCI host bridges
in of_dma_get_range, to ensure we actually look at translations for
the memory space.
