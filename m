Only SDHI1 can be used as MMC interface, from Section 40.1.1 of the SD Card
manual: " This LSI has three SD card interfaces (SDHI0 to SDHI2), one of wh=
ich
can also be used as MMC interfaces (SDHI1)."

It can be used, but when we previously discussed about this I have received=
 bad
feedbacks from both yourself and Geert:
Geert: "I'm a bit reluctant to add "renesas,rcar-gen3-sdhi", though"
You: "I am also reluctant to add "renesas,rcar-gen3-sdhi", because as we ar=
e
seeing things are not so simple wrt to compatible."

We need to make a final decision here, but automatically detecting the IP d=
oesn't
seem to be great, so the final solution has to rely on compatible strings.

Personally, I am not too bothered about using "renesas,rcar-gen3-sdhi"
for this specific IP, as this chip "borrows" Gen3 implementation, but of co=
urse it
exposes some cross compatibility with other families of products which coul=
d result in
some confusion to the final user. Anyway, as long as we document things pro=
perly
there should be no confusion.

Thanks,
Fab
