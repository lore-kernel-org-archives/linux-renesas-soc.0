Thanks for the explanation!

I'm fine with "renesas,r7s9210-pinctrl".

If you're worried for an overlap with another node in DT, keep on using
(lower case) 0x9d1.

The mapping will be rounded up to PAGE_SIZE anyway :-)

Note that you still do have RZA2_PIN_ID_TO_PORT() and
RZA2_PIN_ID_TO_PIN() macros in the driver.
But RZA2_PIN_TO_PIN() sounds really lame...

Any preference from the DT people?

OK.

Perhaps adding a convenience definition

    #define JP PM

may be a good idea? Or just a comment?

    #define PM 21        /* JP */


Anyway, we're getting closer to bikeshedding, so with the real issues fixed:
