Hello!

Here's the set of 11 patches against Simon Horman's 'renesas.git' repo's
'renesas-devel-20180216-v4.16-rc1' tag. I'm adding the device tree support
for the R8A77980-based Condor board (note that NFS root would only work on
the Condor boards [re]wired for booting from EtherAVB -- we haven't been
able to get the 'sh_eth' driver working in either U-Boot or Linux so far).
The necessary SYS-DMAC, [H]SCIF, and EtherAVB bindings updates have been
posted, the clock driver has been reposted yesterday, and the merged patches
have been dropped from this respin of the series...

[1/5] soc: renesas: rcar-sysc: add R8A77980 support
[2/5] arm64: dts: renesas: r8a77980: add [H]SCIF support
[3/5] arm64: dts: renesas: r8a77980: add EtherAVB support
[4/5] arm64: dts: renesas: initial Condor board device tree
[5/5] arm64: dts: renesas: condor: add EtherAVB support

WBR, Sergei
