Don't we already get that information from the iommus DT property ? If =
the DMA=20
engine goes through an IOMMU the property will be set, otherwise it wil=
l not.

That's theoretical. The problem I'm facing today is a DMA engine whose=20=

channels are served by different ports of the same IOMMU. This works in=
 a=20
suboptimal way because I have to keep all the IOMMU ports enabled regar=
dless=20
of whether they're used or not, as the DMA engine and IOMMU APIs don't =
carry=20
channel information.

Does the above-mentioned patch really fix a performance, memory consump=
tion or=20
other issue ?
