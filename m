>From a user point of view, option A looks better to me. However, it has two 
drawbacks:

- Through deciding what pin groups we make available we create a DT ABI that 
will make it difficult to fix mistakes in case the groups are not fine-grained 
enough.

- The data tables in C code are large, and we end up compiling many of them in 
multi-platform kernel, significantly increasing the kernel size.

I would thus favour option B.
