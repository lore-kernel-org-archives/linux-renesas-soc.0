Well, since I'm the one with the "renesas.com" email address, I'll try to
see if I can figure out if the R-Car PFC can be changed to something else f=
or
R-Car Gen4. Same goes for RZ/G. Sometimes the chip designers just keep doin=
g
the same thing over and over again because they don't get any feedback from
the SW guys.

At some point....we do need to leave the "sh-" name behind as I don't reall=
y
see much of a future for SH4 devices. Using something like pinctrl-renesas
is probably a better name. Although, anyone who's watched the semiconductor
business over the years knows that names never stay the same. (sigh)
