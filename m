Yeah, the datasheet also calls these groups :-(
A possible alternative is to use "variant"?

Or, what about avoiding the name issue by making the VIN_DATA_PIN_GROUP()
macro varargs, and passing the "variant" as the (optional) third parameter?
That way existing users work as a before, while you can also write e.g.

    VIN_DATA_PIN_GROUP_VER(vin4_data, 8, _a),

Which patches are using these macro names, and are in v4.20-rc1?

BTW, "grep vin._data_[a-z][0-9] drivers/pinctrl/sh-pfc/*o" tells me we already
have broken groups names on r8a7792, r8a7795, and r8a7796.
Fortunately we have no known users of them, so they can be fixed.

Thanks!

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
