In the case of a single clock source, you don't need names. However,
if the controller has 2 clock sources, you need to name them correctly
so the driver can find the 2nd one. The 2nd clock is for the internal
card detect logic.

v5:
* add Reviewed-by: Geert Uytterhoeven
* list number of clocks for each SoC
* remove example because it already exists in mmc.txt
v4:
* just explain there might be 2 clocks, don't explain how
  we will use them in the driver
v3:
* add more clarification about why there are sometimes 2 clocks
  and what you should do with them.
* remove 'status = "disabled"' from example
v2:
* fix spelling and change wording
* changed clock name from "carddetect" to "cd"

+- clocks: Most controllers only have 1 clock source per channel. However, on
+	  some variations of this controller, the internal card detection
+	  logic that exists in this controller is sectioned off to be run by a
+	  separate second clock source to allow the main core clock to be turned
+	  off to save power.
+	  If 2 clocks are specified by the hardware, you must name them as
+	  "core" and "cd". If the controller only has 1 clock, naming is not
+	  required.
+	  Below is the number clocks for each supported SoC:
+	   1: SH73A0, R8A73A4, R8A7740, R8A7778, R8A7779, R8A7790

 Optional properties:
 - toshiba,mmc-wrprotect-disable: write-protect detection is unavailable
 - pinctrl-names: should be "default", "state_uhs"
