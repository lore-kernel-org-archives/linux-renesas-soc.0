I'm also still thinking about this, cfr. my recent silence w.r.t.
these matters...

On Renesas ARM SoCs (and at least some SH SoCs, but these are stuck in the
pre-DT legacy clock domain), a device needs to be kept running if it is a
wake-up source (e.g. WoL), or if it's part of the wake-up patch (e.g.
irqchip). So in the absence of the GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP flag in the PM
Domain driver, all individual drivers would need to set the IN_BAND_WAKEUP
flag (but see the exception below)
Hence for this class of SoCs, this would duplicate the existing
dev->power.wakeup and dev->power.wakeup_path flags, so that's why I would
prefer using GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP instead (like we already do for the
older SH-Mobile SoCs, but not for newer R-Car and RZ series).
For other SoC families, the situation may be different.

For us, the only exception are devices where the wakeup-source is not the
device itself, but a GPIO, e.g. SDHI card detect. In such a case, only the
device driver knows if the device is to be woken up through a dedicated CD
line, or through a GPIO CD. So that would call for a method to opt-out,
e.g. OUT_BAND_WAKEUP.

To complicate matters, some drivers may be used on SoCs where the device
needs to be kept running (clock and/or power domain), and on SoCs where the
device is always running. This difference is typically handled by genpd,
and the device driver may not even be aware. Of course the driver can just
set IN_BAND_WAKEUP regardless, (else it has to check for the presence of
clocks and/or power-domains properties itself, duplicating genpd
core/driver code).

So what about

         if (IN_BAND_WAKEUP ||
            (GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP && !OUT_BAND_WAKEUP)) {
                ... suspend device...
        }

?

Thanks!
