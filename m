This is rather large for an initial DTSI. Did you give any consideration
to splitting it up: e.g. only providing what is needed to get to a serial
console?

With regards to SMP. Have you checked to make sure CPU hotplug works
on all CPUs? And that the system behaves sanely on suspend/resume.
If it is not possible to verify this at this stage then I would recommend
only enabling one CPU at this stage.
