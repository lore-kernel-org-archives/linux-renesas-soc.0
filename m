Sure, but I expect the DMA engine DT node to list all the relevant IOMMU(s) 
(if any) in the iommus property in a way that allows the DMA engine driver to 
know what IOMMU port is used for what purpose. It will then be up to the DMA 
engine driver to select the right port identifier to pass to the DMA mapping 
API.

I'm not sure how this would work with Robin's proposal of creating one device 
per channel though, as there would still be a single node in DT for the DMA 
engine device. Furthermore, a single channel might indeed have multiple DMA 
masters, not all of them being served by an IOMMU. We would thus still need 
memory port identifiers in the DMA mapping API.
