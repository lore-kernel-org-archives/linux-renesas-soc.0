The method we use to indicate a stop command error to the mmc core, is
to set ->stop.error in the host driver before completing the request.
Perhaps set it to -EIO or -EILSEQ.

In that way mmc_blk_err_check() sees the error and invokes the
mmc_blk_cmd_recovery() to deal with it (response parsing etc).

Does that work for you?

Kind regards
