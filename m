I don't think this is true.

I just added a argument to bootargs to salvator-common.dtsi for some 
hack testing and it took effect. Tested on-top of latest renesas-drivers 
and H3 ES2.0.

And the module parameter had the expected effect on the adv7482x driver.  
Is there another issue here which I'm missing?
