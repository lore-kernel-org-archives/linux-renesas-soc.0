With Renesas R-Car3 we will get a whole family of SoCs. I.e. different 
computing power (e.g. different number of Cores) with more or less 
similar peripherals.

I would think that we want to reflect this in the device tree, too. 
Therefore I think what we want is a hierarchy of device trees. Similar 
what's done with other SoC families (compare e.g. i.MX6).

E.g. we want an initial rcar3.dtsi, which contains all common parts of 
all R-Car3 SoCs. E.g. one CA57 core, the SCIF where its common etc.

Then you will have the r8a779x.dtsi which includes the rcar3.dtsi and 
extends it for SoC specific parts. Which then will be included by the 
board device trees, as already done, now.

Or in other words: As soon as you have similar parts in the 
r8a779x.dtsi's, it's time to think about moving the parts one hierarchy 
level up into the rcar3.dtsi. Else you will end up in a maintenance hell 
once you have to change/fix anything.

Best regards

Dirk
