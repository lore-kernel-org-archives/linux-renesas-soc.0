So, a quick hack and it seems that works. I get my family of SoC that I
can select XIP_KERNEL.

I'll do some build experiments, and if it looks like it will work, I'll
send off a patch to see how opposes it.
For the most part, if everyone is off playing in the multiplatform pool,
me creating a new ARM V7 single-platform pool won't affect anyone.
