Hi Geert,

Thanks for the patches, sorry I can't test these either... It's been quite =
a few
years since I had an sh7264 or sh7269 board!

Thanks
Phil

This all looks good to me, even if I can't test or verify patches 2/4 to 4/=
4 as I don't have access to the hardware or datasheet either. Given that th=
ey're untested I wouldn't fake the error message in the commit log though, =
but just refer to the problem noticed on sh7722.

Apart from that, for the whole series,
