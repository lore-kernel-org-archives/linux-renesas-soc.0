I think in reality, both are gated by the same MSSR bit ;-)

However, if the driver needs to know the frequency of the clock, or control it
(e.g. it's driving some external interface), it's always interested in the
module's internal clock, not the clock used for register access.  The latter
is just an artifact of synchronous hardware.

I've just finished going over all modules and their (known) parents on R-Car
H3 (ES1.x and ES2.0), and M3-W.
If multiple clock inputs are known, we always use the internal clock, which
is consistent with my comment above.

We typically don't list all other parents clocks, unless we need to
query/control them (especially if they can't be gated from Linux, like the
internal SxDy clocks).
