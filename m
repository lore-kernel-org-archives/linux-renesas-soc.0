This patch set is based on the renesas-drivers.git /
renesas-drivers-2016-02-16-v4.5-rc4 tag
(commit id = a633abe6e6393c60417bd8cb0cf82f3297740198),
and the following patches:

[ renesas_usbhs driver ]
http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/balbi/usb.git/commit/?h=testing/next&id=cff0fef33d77bd7e98463029e5d0a4191d9bbb95

[ generic phy driver for R-Car H3 ]
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/2120685

This patch set contains patches that are related to generic phy driver.
As I wrote a comment in patch 7, to handle VBUS on/off for USB2.0 host
channel 0, I use a regulator driver instead of extcon/max3355 driver.
This is a reason that I marked this patch set is a RFC because I'm not
sure that this way is acceptable or not.

Also patch 5 should resolve checkpatch.pl warnings, and patch 6 should
have dmas property to use USB-DMAC later.

Changes from v1:
 - Remove PFC for usb2.0 host patch because it contains the renesas-drivers.
 - Change the patch order of the phy driver. (clean up code is in first.)
 - Change the property of "phy-supply" to "vbus-supply".
