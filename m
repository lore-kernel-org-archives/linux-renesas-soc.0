Hi Geert,

Here's an update.

I've investigated the problem further, and realized the freeze was caused by 
writing to the PWRONCR_OFFS register, not the SYSCISCR register. It doesn't 
occur immediately though, I had to put longer delays between the register 
writes to locate the faulty one.

Furthermore, I've also realized that commenting out the A3SH power domain from 
DT seemed to fix the problem. Unused power domains are powered off at the end 
of the boot sequence, and it looks like powering A3SH there somehow messes up 
the SYSC and hangs the system the next time a power domain is turned on.

Given that the latest version of the datasheet doesn't document the A3SH power 
domain it would probably be a good idea to remove it, at least until we can 
get more information from the hardware team.
