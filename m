Yes, I read the thread and understand all of this part.

Well before we get to initcalls, the kernel calls the arch specific
time_init() which (on ARM) calls of_clk_init (for all the reasons
above) and then timer_probe(). When timer_probe returns, it is
expected that you have setup a clocksource and clockevent. If you
haven't, then at some point before we get to initcalls we should hang
because we're not getting any timer interrupts and time is not
advancing. At least that's how it used to be and maybe something has
changed (It's been a while since I've looked at this area). Maybe you
just get lucky and it works as long as no thread blocks (e.g. on a
msleep). If things changed and you can setup a timer in an initcall,
then why are folks still trying to do things like early platform
drivers. Regular drivers would work and we should be able to
completely remove CLK_OF_DECLARE and TIMER_OF_DECLARE.
