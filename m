So, you didn't see timeouts anymore?

I got similar numbers for my SanDisk and Samsung cards. While the SDR104
speed is not that what I hoped for, it is still an improvement over
SDR50. We are currently investigating if DMA causes a bottleneck
somewhere perhaps. Except for a minor comment, I'd think these patches
are good to go in and we could improve incrementally from here:

Maybe Ulf can have another high-level view on those. I guess he is more
experienced with the tuning stuff?

Thanks,
