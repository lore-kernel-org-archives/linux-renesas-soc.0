Subject: [PATCH 2/3] PM / core: Add WAKEUP_PATH driver flag

During system suspend, a driver may find that the wakeup setting is enabled
for its device and therefore configures it to deliver system wakeup
signals.

Additionally, sometimes the driver and its device, relies on some further
consumed resource, like an irqchip or a phy for example, to stay powered
on, as to be able to deliver system wakeup signals.

In general the driver deals with this, via raising an "enable count" of the
consumed resource or via a subsystem specific API, like irq_set_irq_wake()
or enable|disable_irq_wake() for an irqchip.

However, this information about the wakeup path for resources, is currently
not available to a PM domain (unless it has some HW-logic that knows this),
which means that it may decide to power off a device and its PM domain. In
other words, it may prevent the wakeup signal from being delivered.

For this reason, let's introduce a new WAKEUP_PATH driver flag, to allow a
driver to indicate that it controls a resource needed in the wakeup path.
Make the PM core to check the WAKEUP_PATH flag immediately after the
->suspend() callback has been invoked and set the wakeup_path status flag
accordingly. In this way the wakeup_path flag also becomes propagated to
the parent device, which may be useful for some cases.

For a PM domain that needs the information about the wakeup path, it should
check the wakeup_path status flag for its attached devices in a later
suspend phase, but perhaps also the WAKEUP_PATH driver flag explicitly, in
case it has been set after the ->suspend() callback has been invoked for
the device.
