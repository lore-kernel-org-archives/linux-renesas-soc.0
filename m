OK. Looking through the history log, I saw it different ways, so I was=20
not sure.

A while back, I was reading/hearing about how board DT file do not have=20
to be GPL and the user should not have to be forced to make this GPL.=20
(Maybe at some ELC conference or on LWN or something)
So in our RZ/A BSP that I release to customers I would use this dual=20
license. You can see the exact same license in a number of dts files in=20
mainline.

Since there is no SPDX for this, I figure Rob might have some opinion on
the matter.
And, if I have to make it GLP for the mainline version, then I will just
replace the license when I release the customer BSP (since I wrote it,=20
I can do that). But, I would be nice to keep the BSP version as close to
mainline as I can.
