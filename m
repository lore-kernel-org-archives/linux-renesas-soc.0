Subject: [PATCH v2 0/2] arm64: dts: r8a7795: FCPF and FDP1 device nodes
Date: Thu, 30 Jun 2016 14:32:41 +0100

Hi Simon,

Here is my updated series for the dts updates in relation to the RCar/FDP1.

The fcpf patch has collected a reviewed-by from Geert, whilst the fdp1
patch has collected a reviewed by from both Laurent and Geert, with a
small change to remove the labels, as they will not be referenced.

You responded to my previous set for these with the following comment:

Your assumption was correct, and they could be applied without breakage.

RobH has acked the binding for the RCar FCPF, but I have not seen an ack for
the FDP1 binding yet. I'll follow that up, and ping you on the fdp1 dts patch
when it resolved.

Regards

Kieran
