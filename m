Hi Geert,

I've got this message from Renesas:
"

Please use H3ULCB/M3ULCB in upstream.
# I got an agreement among parties.

Board name in community: ULCB (= development code name)
Official name (product/brand name): Starter Kit Pro/Premier
"

Renaming  H3ULCB -> H3SK is not desired for Renesas.

What do you think to append the product/brand name only? :

-        H3ULCB (RTP0RC7795SKB00010S)
+       H3ULCB (R-Car Starter Kit Premier, RTP0RC7795SKB00010S)
          compatible = "renesas,h3ulcb", "renesas,r8a7795";

Regards,
Vladimir
