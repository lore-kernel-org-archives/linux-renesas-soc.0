	Hi Simon, Magnus,

This patch series renames the serial port clock to fck, as accepted in
the DT bindings in v4.5-rc1.

Changes compared to v4:
  - Changed one-line summary prefix to match current arm-soc practices,
  - Split off h8/300 patch,
  - Rebased,

Changes compared to v3:
  - Add Acked-by,
  - Update for "[PATCH 0/2] ARM: shmobile: r8a7793: Increase scif
    support".

Dependencies:
  - This series was created on top of "[PATCH v4 0/7] ARM: dts: R-Car:
    Add SCIF fallback compatibility strings", but I think it applies to
    plain renesas-devel-20160129-v4.5-rc1, too.

Thanks for applying!

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
