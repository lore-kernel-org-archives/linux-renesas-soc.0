Thanks Olof,

as I think you can see we have adjusted things somewhat in the light of
the feedback you provided during the v4.18 development cycle. And we'll
continue to do so.

In the case of enabling various devices for the r8a77980 I do take your
point with regards to squashing patches. Although I believe that in this
case the patches came in over time, which makes them a little less obvious
candidates for squashing than would be the case if they came in all at
once. Nonetheless, I'll continue to work with the team to streamline our
processes and make the pull requests as easy to digest as possible.
